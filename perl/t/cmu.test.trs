<Sync time="0.65"/>
okay
<Sync time="1.173"/>
/background/
<Sync time="8.436"/>
what's the new version
<Sync time="9.442"/>

<Sync time="11.038"/>
&lt;[w (what)]&gt; new version of what /lg/
<Sync time="12.683"/>
/background/
<Sync time="29.016"/>
they're kind of flaky /h#/
<Sync time="30.493"/>
/background/
<Sync time="35.097"/>
yeah
<Sync time="35.589"/>
/background/
<Sync time="41.361"/>
/h#/ /um/ &lt;it's it's [im (improved)]&gt; it's improved on Macintosh like it actually works on Macintosh now /h#/ /um/
<Sync time="47.045"/>

<Sync time="47.563"/>
which it didn't really do before /h#/ and then
<Sync time="50.278"/>
&lt;it's&gt; yeah so it's actually alright now on the Mac it's kind of stable and /h#/ there's only like one problem really on Linux that i had
<Sync time="56.925"/>
/background/
<Sync time="61.098"/>
yeah &lt;if you&gt; if you
<Sync time="62.763"/>
&lt;well it'll build that [d_m (d_m_g)]&gt; &lt;i think it builds that [d_m (d_m_g)]&gt; if you type make d_m_g it'll do the right thing
<Sync time="67.118"/>
/background/
<Sync time="86.834"/>
okay
<Sync time="87.356"/>
/background/
<Sync time="124.91"/>
oh good /h#/
<Sync time="126.62"/>
well this is much improved so &lt;[dub (w)]&gt; /uh/ m_r_c_p &lt;now&gt; /uh/ now that it's not using the crappy threading it's only using fifteen percent of c_p_u on my mac instead of like a hundred /h#/
<Sync time="136.524"/>
so i could &lt;[act (actually)]&gt; &lt;so actually i&gt; my batteries will actually last the whole meeting possibly /lg/
<Sync time="142.189"/>

<Sync time="147.398"/>
/h#/ &lt;i&gt; i think so yeah
<Sync time="149.225"/>

<Sync time="153.925"/>
/h#/ oh you know what &lt;it actually might have been&gt; &lt;i think it may have been that&gt; also might have been that call to /um/ /h#/
<Sync time="159.012"/>
wait for read because apparently wait for read actually busy waits 
<Sync time="161.679"/>
i was reading the documentation they say don't use this if you don't have to because it's just gonna busy wait
<Sync time="165.428"/>
/background/
<Sync time="166.285"/>
so
<Sync time="166.882"/>

<Sync time="170.116"/>
/noise/ might be on all platforms yeah
<Sync time="172.164"/>

<Sync time="176.75"/>
/ls/ /h#/ /mumble/ see &lt;the thing&gt; the thing about that call
<Sync time="179.301"/>

<Sync time="181.84"/>
yeah /h#/ the thing i don't quite understand &lt;about that call&gt; about having that call there is that you know if the socket is non blocking you try and read and it says &lt;no&gt; no data and you just go back into your loop and you wait some more and then you pull it again right i mean /h#/
<Sync time="193.608"/>

<Sync time="196.2"/>
huh
<Sync time="196.715"/>

<Sync time="199.763"/>
/mm/ /hm/
<Sync time="200.254"/>
/background/
<Sync time="212.098"/>
/h#/ oh whoa so &lt;it's&gt; it actually exists on Windows too then /lg/ 
<Sync time="216.284"/>
okay so that stuff just doesn't work
<Sync time="218.537"/>
/h#/
<Sync time="219.316"/>

<Sync time="239.014"/>
/hm/
<Sync time="240.514"/>

<Sync time="252.905"/>
&lt;is that&gt; do you those connection errors are due to that thing though or
<Sync time="256.164"/>

<Sync time="257.011"/>
yeah i don't know
<Sync time="257.731"/>

<Sync time="259.045"/>
is there a new build of it or
<Sync time="260.694"/>

<Sync time="268.405"/>
oh okay huh
<Sync time="270.027"/>
/background/
<Sync time="273.077"/>
not until i started fixing it /lg/ /h#/
<Sync time="277.1"/>

<Sync time="289.556"/>
/uh/
<Sync time="290.171"/>

<Sync time="293.332"/>
&lt;it&gt; it does seem to leak memory but anyway /lg/
<Sync time="296.976"/>

<Sync time="310.891"/>
/mm/ [kay (okay)] &lt;what is this&gt; what is this
<Sync time="312.569"/>

<Sync time="313.807"/>
what is this version that people &lt;are&gt; are trying to run that's failing for them is it something they've just compiled or is it something
<Sync time="319.166"/>

<Sync time="319.604"/>
/oh/ it's the
<Sync time="320.354"/>

<Sync time="325.723"/>
/noise/
<Sync time="326.007"/>

<Sync time="326.343"/>
the problem is that people are not running the stuff that's the latest running build from a few days ago too like and we've changed things since then haven't we
<Sync time="333.3"/>

<Sync time="335.995"/>
yeah i guess that's true
<Sync time="337.095"/>

<Sync time="361.033"/>
