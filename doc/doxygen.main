/** \mainpage Sphinx 3 Internals Documentation
 *
 * This manual documents the functions, files and the internal variables
 * of Sphinx 3's recognizers (both fast and slow). Currently, we intend it
 * to be used only by Sphinx developers.  We do not recommend users to use the
 * internal function at this point because they are still quite
 * unstable.
