	Sphinx 3.6 Release Candidate I
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	The corresponding SphinxTrain's tag is SPHINX3_6_CMU_INTERNAL_RELEASE
	One can check out the matching SphinxTrain of the sphinx3.6 release by command,

	A Summary of Sphinx 3.6 RCI
	---------------------------

	Sphinx 3.6 is a gently refactored version of Sphinx 3.5.  Our
	programming is defensive and we only aim at further
	consolidation and unification our code-bases in Sphinx 3.

	Despite our programming is defensive, there are still several
	interesting and new features could be found in this
	release. Their details could be found in the "New Feature"
	section below. Here is a brief summary:
	
	1, Further speed-up of CIGMMS in the 4 level GMM Computation
	Schemes (4LGC)
	2, Multiple regression classes an MAP adaptation in SphinxTrain
	3, Better support in using LM in Sphinx 3.X.  
	4, FSG search is now supported. This is adapted from Sphinx 2. 
	5, Support of full triphone search in flat lexicon search. 
	6, Some support of different character sets other than of
	Sphinx 3.X.  Models in multiple languages are now tested in
	Sphinx 3.X.

	We hope you enjoy this release candidate. In future, we will
	continue to improve the quality of CMU Sphinx and CMU Sphinx's
	related software.

	New Features 
	------------
	-Speaker Adaptation:
	a, Multiple regression class (phoneme-based) is now supported. 
	
	-GMM Computation 
	a, Improvements of CIGMMs is now incorporated. 
	  i, One could specify the upper limit of the number of CD
	  senones to be computed in each frame by specifying -maxcdsenpf.
          ii, The best Gaussian index (BGI) are not stored and could
	  be used as a mechanism to speed up GMM computation
	  iii, tightening-factor (-tighten_factor) is introduced to
	  smooth between fix naive down-sampling technique and CI-GMMS.
	b, Support of SCHMM and FCHMM
	  i, decode will fully support computation of SCHMM. 
	
	-Language Model 
	a, reading an LM in ARPA text format is now supported. Users
	now have an option to by-pass the use of lm3g2dmp.
	b, live decoding API now supports switching of language models. 
	c, full support of class-based LM. See also the Bug fixes section
	d, lm_convert is introduced. lm_convert supersede the
	functionalities of lm3g2dmp. Not only could lm_convert convert an LM 
	from TXT format to DMP format.  It could also do the reverse.  

	-Search 
	This part will detail the change we make in different search
	algorithms.
	In 3.6, collection of algorithms could all be used under a
	single executable decode.  decode_anytopo is still reserved
	for backward compatibility purpose. 
	Decode now support three modes of search. 
	Mode 2 (FSG): (Adapted from Sphinx 2) FSG search. 
	Mode 3 (FLAT): Flat-lexicon search. (The original search in decode_anytopo in 3.X (X < 6))
	Mode 4 (TREE): Tree-lexicion search. (The original search in decode in 3.X (x<6) 
	
	
	Some of these functionalities will only be applicable in one
	particular search. We will mark tem with FSG, FLAT and TREE. 

	a, One could now turn off -bt_wsil to control whether silence
	should be used as the ending word.  (FLAT, TREE)

	-Frontend
	a, -dither is now supported in live_pretend and
	live_decode, the initial seed could always be set the command
	-seed. (Jerry Wolf will be very happy about this feature.)

	-Miscellaneous
	a, One could turn on built-in letter-to-sound rule in dict.c by using -lts_mismatch. 
	b, current Sphinx 3.6 is tested to work on setup of English,
	Chinese Mandarin, French and English. 
	c, changes in ep: [To be filled in.]

	Bug fixes
	---------
	-Miscellaneous memory leak fixed in the tree search (mode 4)
	-Initialization class-based LM routine use to switch the order of
	word insertion penalty and language model weight. This is now fixed. 
	-Assertion generated vithist.c is now turn into an error
	message.  Instead of causing the whole program stopped.  The
	decoding will just fail for that sentnece. 
	-Number of CI phones could now be at most 32767 (instead of 127)
	-[1236322]: libutil\str2words special character bugs. 

	Behavior Changes
	----------------
	-Endpointer (ep) now used computation of s3 log. 

	-Multi-stream GMM computation will not truncate the pdf to 8
	bit anymore.  This will avoid confusion of programmer. However

	-Except in allphone and align, When .cont. is used in
	-senmgau, the code will automatically turn to use fast GMM computation
	routine. To make sure the multiple-stream GMM computation will
	be in effect, one need to specify .s3cont.

	-executable dag hadn't accounted for the language weight.  Now
	this issue is fixed.

	Functions still under test 
	-----------------------------------------
	-Encoding conversion in lm_convert. 
	-Confidence estimation, the computations of forward and
	backward posterior probability have mismatch
	-LIUM contribution. LM could now represented as AT&T fsm format.

	sphinx 3.5 release
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	The corresponding SphinxTrain's tag is SPHINX3_5_CMU_INTERNAL_RELEASE
	One can check out the matching SphinxTrain of the sphinx3.5 release by command,
	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cmusphinx/ co -r SPHINX3_5_CMU_INTERNAL_RELEASE SphinxTrain
	New features of this release, 
	-Live-mode APIs are stable and are now officially released. 
	 -windows version of live-mode decoder based on the new APIS is released. 
	 -live-mode decoder simulator (livepretend) based on the new APIS is still under development. We expect it to be stable in Sphinx 3.6. 
	-Mean transformation by matrix is now supported. 
	-4 tools of s3.0 are now incorporated in Sphinx 3.x.

	 2, astar - an N-best genertor,
	 3, allphone - a phoneme-recognizer,
