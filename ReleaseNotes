	sphinx 3.5 release
	The corresponding SphinxTrain timestamp is ????????
	One can check out the matching SphinxTrain of the sphinx3.5 release by command,
	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cmusphinx/ co SphinxTrain
	New features of this release, 
	-Live-mode APIs are stable and are now officially released. 
	-Mean transformation by matrix is now supported. 
	-4 tools of s3.0 are now incorporated in Sphinx 3.x. 
	 1, align - an aligner,
	 2, astar - an N-best genertor,
	 3, allphone - a phoneme-recognizer,
	 4, dag - a best-path finder for a lattice.
	-The feature extraction libraries of sphinx3 is now EXACTLY the
	 same sas SphinxTrain.
	
	Corresponding changes in SphinxTrain
	SphinxTrian timestamp ???????? 
	correspond to sphinx 3.5 release
	Changes since the last record.
	-The feature extraction libraries of SphinxTrain is now
	EXACTLY the same as sphinx3. 
	-New tools introduced:
	1, mllr_solve, given the EM posterior probabilities of the
	mean and regression class definition. This routine estimate
	regression matrices for each class. 
	2, mllr_transform, given a matrix, this tools applies the
	transformation to the mean vector of the models. 
	-The command line interface for all SphinxTrain's tools are unified. 

	

2004-05-24  Arthur Chan (archan@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
	sphinx 3.4 release. 
	-Numerous bugs of s3.3 are fixed 
	 1, -feat_type is not hard-wired now. 
	 2, bugs of the live_mode recognizer is exterminated. 
	 3, sphinx3-simple and sphinx3-test are working. 
	-Evandro added are directory for testing.  
	Those are mainly for internal use.
	-Fast GMM computation techniques are included,
	 1, Support of down-sampling
	 2, Support of CI-based GMM selection
	 3, Support of VQ-based and SVQ-based Gaussian Selection
	 4, Support of SVQ with arbitrary number of sub-vectors. 
	-Phoneme look-ahead implemented, currently it supports 4 types of heuristics. 
	0, no, 1, max , 2 sum, 3 1st. 
	-Support multi-LM specified offline. 
	-Support class-based LM 
	-prototype of live-mode APIs are included. Not stable, for internal use only. 

2002-11-08  Evandro Gouvea (egouvea@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
	- Converted Makefiles to use GNU's autoconf, automake, libtool etc.
	- Added acoustic model, language model, dictionary, etc to use as
          an example system in a release.
        - Release of the Sphinx-3 package.

2001-01-01   Rita Singh (rsingh@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
	- Introduced live-mode interface
	  
2000-02-29   M. K. Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
	- Changed compile-time selection of 3 or 5-state HMM (with two 
	  executables) into a single binary that does a run-time selection.
	- Makefile changes to go with the above

2000-02-12   M. K. Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
	- Consolidated all code under a single directory.
	- Removed SubVQ-PhoneProb (svqpp) hack for prediction of active phones.

1999-12-17   M. K. Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
	- Added src/libcontmgau/gausubvq.c for sub-vector clustering of 
	  acoustic models, and related changes to libcontmgau.

1999-12-13   M. K. Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
	- Added ability to process a single utterance over and over, 
	  waiting for file timestamp (modification time) to change 
	  between iterations.
	- Added new output format for lattice files, for smaller size.
	- Added SubVQ-PhoneProb module for prediction of active phones.
	- Added special handling of 3-state, no-skip topology HMMs.
	- Fixed bug in hmm-evaluation of non-emitting exit state scores.

1999-11-23   M. K. Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
	- Initial release.
	- Lextree decoder using continuous density HMMs.
	- Batch mode only.
	- Cepstra input only.
