	- Introduced live-mode interface
	  
2000-02-29	M. K. Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
	- Changed compile-time selection of 3 or 5-state HMM (with two executables)
	  into a single binary that does a run-time selection.
	- Makefile changes to go with the above

2000-02-12	M. K. Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
	- Consolidated all code under a single directory.
	- Removed SubVQ-PhoneProb (svqpp) hack for prediction of active phones.

1999-12-17	M. K. Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
	- Added src/libcontmgau/gausubvq.c for sub-vector clustering of acoustic
	  models, and related changes to libcontmgau.

1999-12-13	M. K. Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
	- Added ability to process a single utterance over and over, waiting for
	  file timestamp (modification time) to change between iterations.
	- Added new output format for lattice files, for smaller size.
	- Added SubVQ-PhoneProb module for prediction of active phones.
	- Added special handling of 3-state, no-skip topology HMMs.
	- Fixed bug in hmm-evaluation of non-emitting exit state scores.

1999-11-23	M. K. Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
