INFORMATION
-----------

Files in these sub-directories are parts of source code of the ASR system developed by the LIUM (Computer Sciences Laboratory of the University of Le Mans, France). 
The LIUM's ASR system is based on the CMU Sphinx Project : it is a multi-pass system using the sphinx3 tools during some passes and evolutions of the s4 tools in the other ones.

Unfortunately, our code was not written in the objective to distribute it, but only for an internal use to make some scientific experiments. As we think now that some of our work can be benefit for the Sphinx community, we plan to integrate them into the canonical versions of the sX.x decoders.


Before starting this porting work, we have decided to check this work into a LIUM branch of the Sphinx Project: files in these sub-
directories are a first part of this work. 

Another sub-directory will be added soon concerning Sphinxtrain.

People who want to help us to port this are welcome.


Sub-directories
---------------

sphinx4: the LIUM's version of Sphinx 4 ("as is"), including acoustic rescoring tool of word-graphes and another version of a confusion network generator used for MPE training of acoustic models.

lm_tools_32bits_file64bits: C library to manage n-gram model whatever n. Including a version of lm_convert and tools to rescore lattice-word with 4-gram (or more with few modifications).



WARNING
-------

As said above, these source codes were initially written for an internal use by a little team of researchers. Please be (very) tolerant with us: sometimes there are no comment, sometimes they are in French, sometimes in a bad english. More, variable or function names can be understandable. During the porting work, be confident that will be corrected, of course.
