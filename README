This is Sphinx 3.4 (s3.4), one of Carnegie Mellon University's open
source large vocabulary, speaker-independent continuous speech
recognition engine. Please see the LICENSE file for terms of use.

Over the course of development, Sphinx-3 branched into different
versions. The version available here, often times referred to as
"sphinx3.4", "s3.4", or "fast decoder", is a faster version of the
original code. Higher speed has been achieved at the cost of less
accuracy compared to the slow decoder.

THIS IS A RESEARCH SYSTEM. This is also an early release of a research
system. We know the APIs and function names are likely to change, and
that several tools need to be made available to make this all
complete. With your help and contributions, this can progress in
response to the needs and patches provided.

For documentation, please use your web browser to see
doc/index.html. If you install the distribution in the default
location, you can access the documentation here:

The s3.4 decoder is a live-mode capable version of the s3.2 decoder.
The decoder routine is stored in a library called libs3decoder.a. The
decoder function takes blocks of speech samples and returns partial
hypotheses for the blocks decoded during runtime. Examples of its use
are given in main_live_example.c and main_live_pretend.c

This directory contains the scripts and instructions necessary for
decoding speech input using the CMU Sphinx Recognizer.

This distribution is free software, see LICENSE for license.

This work was built over a large number of years at CMU by most of the
people in the Sphinx Group. Some code goes back to 1986. The most
recent work in tidying this up for release includes the following,
listed alphabetically (at least these are the people who are most
likely able to help you).


Installation Guide:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This sections contain installation guide for various platforms. 

Linux/Unix Installation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This distribution now uses GNU autoconf to find out basic information
about your system, and should compile on most Unix and Unix-like
systems, and certainly on Linux.  To build, simply run

    ./configure
    make

(Or whatever you call GNU Make). This should configure everything
automatically. After a successful compilation, you may test the system
by running

    make test

and then install it with

    make install

This defaults to installing Sphinx-3 under /usr/local. You may
customize it by running ./configure with an argument, as in

    ./configure --prefix=/my/own/installation/directory

Windows Installation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To compile the sphinx 3.4 in Visual C++ 6.0, 
1, unzip the file.
2, click programs.dsw 
3, build the projects in the following order, libaudio, libdecoder, libutil.
4, build the live-mode decoder project, livedecode.
5, build the live-mode simulator project, livepretend.
6, build the batch-mode recognizer project, decode.  

Steps 4-7 can be done easily by in the "File View" of VC6.0 by
left-clicking the project and choose "Build".  To run the executable,
please remember to set the corresponding active project. 

If you are using cygwin, the installation procedure is very similar to
the Unix installation. However, there is no audio driver support in
cygwin currently so one can only use the batch mode recognzier.
