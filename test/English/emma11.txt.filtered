emma woodhouse  handsome  clever  and rich  with a comfortable home
and happy disposition  seemed to unite some of the best blessings
of existence  and had lived nearly twenty one years in the world
with very little to distress or vex her <end>

she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate 
indulgent father  and had  in consequence of her sister s marriage 
been mistress of his house from a very early period <end>  her mother
had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct
remembrance of her caresses  and her place had been supplied
by an excellent woman as governess  who had fallen little short
of a mother in affection <end>

sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr <end> woodhouse s family 
less as a governess than a friend  very fond of both daughters 
but particularly of emma <end>  between  them  it was more the intimacy
of sisters <end>  even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal
office of governess  the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed
her to impose any restraint  and the shadow of authority being
now long passed away  they had been living together as friend and
friend very mutually attached  and emma doing just what she liked 
highly esteeming miss taylor s judgment  but directed chiefly by
her own <end>

the real evils  indeed  of emma s situation were the power of having
rather too much her own way  and a disposition to think a little
too well of herself  these were the disadvantages which threatened
alloy to her many enjoyments <end>  the danger  however  was at present
so unperceived  that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes
with her <end>

sorrow came  a gentle sorrow  but not at all in the shape of any
disagreeable consciousness <end>  miss taylor married <end>  it was miss
taylor s loss which first brought grief <end>  it was on the wedding day
of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought
of any continuance <end>  the wedding over  and the bride people gone 
her father and herself were left to dine together  with no prospect
of a third to cheer a long evening <end>  her father composed himself
to sleep after dinner  as usual  and she had then only to sit
and think of what she had lost <end>

the event had every promise of happiness for her friend <end>  mr <end> weston
was a man of unexceptionable character  easy fortune  suitable age 
and pleasant manners  and there was some satisfaction in considering
with what self denying  generous friendship she had always wished
and promoted the match  but it was a black morning s work for her <end>
the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day <end>
she recalled her past kindness  the kindness  the affection of sixteen
years  how she had taught and how she had played with her from five
years old  how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse
her in health  and how nursed her through the various illnesses
of childhood <end>  a large debt of gratitude was owing here  but the
intercourse of the last seven years  the equal footing and perfect
unreserve which had soon followed isabella s marriage  on their
being left to each other  was yet a dearer  tenderer recollection <end>
she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed  intelligent 
well informed  useful  gentle  knowing all the ways of the family 
interested in all its concerns  and peculiarly interested in herself 
in every pleasure  every scheme of hers  one to whom she could speak
every thought as it arose  and who had such an affection for her
as could never find fault <end>

how was she to bear the change   it was true that her friend was
going only half a mile from them  but emma was aware that great must
be the difference between a mrs <end> weston  only half a mile from them 
and a miss taylor in the house  and with all her advantages 
natural and domestic  she was now in great danger of suffering
from intellectual solitude <end>  she dearly loved her father  but he
was no companion for her <end>  he could not meet her in conversation 
rational or playful <end>

the evil of the actual disparity in their ages  and mr <end> woodhouse had
not married early  was much increased by his constitution and habits 
for having been a valetudinarian all his life  without activity
of mind or body  he was a much older man in ways than in years 
and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart
and his amiable temper  his talents could not have recommended him
at any time <end>

her sister  though comparatively but little removed by matrimony 
being settled in london  only sixteen miles off  was much beyond
her daily reach  and many a long october and november evening must
be struggled through at hartfield  before christmas brought the next
visit from isabella and her husband  and their little children 
to fill the house  and give her pleasant society again <end>

highbury  the large and populous village  almost amounting to a town 
to which hartfield  in spite of its separate lawn  and shrubberies 
and name  did really belong  afforded her no equals <end>  the woodhouses
were first in consequence there <end>  all looked up to them <end>  she had
many acquaintance in the place  for her father was universally civil 
but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss
taylor for even half a day <end>  it was a melancholy change  and emma
could not but sigh over it  and wish for impossible things 
till her father awoke  and made it necessary to be cheerful <end>
his spirits required support <end>  he was a nervous man  easily depressed 
fond of every body that he was used to  and hating to part with them 
hating change of every kind <end>  matrimony  as the origin of change 
was always disagreeable  and he was by no means yet reconciled
to his own daughter s marrying  nor could ever speak of her but
with compassion  though it had been entirely a match of affection 
when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too  and from
his habits of gentle selfishness  and of being never able to
suppose that other people could feel differently from himself 
he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad
a thing for herself as for them  and would have been a great deal
happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield <end>
emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could  to keep him
from such thoughts  but when tea came  it was impossible for him
not to say exactly as he had said at dinner 

 poor miss taylor   i wish she were here again <end>  what a pity it
is that mr <end> weston ever thought of her  

 i cannot agree with you  papa  you know i cannot <end>  mr <end> weston is such
a good humoured  pleasant  excellent man  that he thoroughly deserves
a good wife   and you would not have had miss taylor live with us
for ever  and bear all my odd humours  when she might have a house of her own  

 a house of her own   but where is the advantage of a house of her own 
this is three times as large <end>  and you have never any odd humours 
my dear <end> 

 how often we shall be going to see them  and they coming to see
us   we shall be always meeting   we  must begin  we must go and pay
wedding visit very soon <end> 

 my dear  how am i to get so far  randalls is such a distance <end>
i could not walk half so far <end> 

 no  papa  nobody thought of your walking <end>  we must go in the carriage 
to be sure <end> 

 the carriage  but james will not like to put the horses to for
such a little way   and where are the poor horses to be while we
are paying our visit  

 they are to be put into mr <end> weston s stable  papa <end>  you know we
have settled all that already <end>  we talked it all over with mr <end> weston
last night <end>  and as for james  you may be very sure he will always like
going to randalls  because of his daughter s being housemaid there <end>
i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else <end>  that was
your doing  papa <end>  you got hannah that good place <end>  nobody thought
of hannah till you mentioned her  james is so obliged to you  

 i am very glad i did think of her <end>  it was very lucky  for i would
not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account 
and i am sure she will make a very good servant  she is a civil 
pretty spoken girl  i have a great opinion of her <end>  whenever i see her 
she always curtseys and asks me how i do  in a very pretty manner 
and when you have had her here to do needlework  i observe she
always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it <end>
i am sure she will be an excellent servant  and it will be a great
comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is
used to see <end>  whenever james goes over to see his daughter  you know 
she will be hearing of us <end>  he will be able to tell her how we
all are <end> 

emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas 
and hoped  by the help of backgammon  to get her father tolerably
through the evening  and be attacked by no regrets but her own <end>
the backgammon table was placed  but a visitor immediately afterwards
walked in and made it unnecessary <end>

mr <end> knightley  a sensible man about seven or eight and thirty  was not
only a very old and intimate friend of the family  but particularly
connected with it  as the elder brother of isabella s husband <end>
he lived about a mile from highbury  was a frequent visitor 
and always welcome  and at this time more welcome than usual 
as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london <end>  he had
returned to a late dinner  after some days  absence  and now walked
up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square <end>
it was a happy circumstance  and animated mr <end> woodhouse for some time <end>
mr <end> knightley had a cheerful manner  which always did him good 
and his many inquiries after  poor isabella  and her children were
answered most satisfactorily <end>  when this was over  mr <end> woodhouse
gratefully observed   it is very kind of you  mr <end> knightley  to come
out at this late hour to call upon us <end>  i am afraid you must have
had a shocking walk <end> 

 not at all  sir <end>  it is a beautiful moonlight night  and so mild
that i must draw back from your great fire <end> 

 but you must have found it very damp and dirty <end>  i wish you may
not catch cold <end> 

 dirty  sir  look at my shoes <end>  not a speck on them <end> 

 well  that is quite surprising  for we have had a vast deal
of rain here <end>  it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour
while we were at breakfast <end>  i wanted them to put off the wedding <end> 

 by the bye  i have not wished you joy <end>  being pretty well aware
of what sort of joy you must both be feeling  i have been in no hurry
with my congratulations  but i hope it all went off tolerably well <end>
how did you all behave  who cried most  

 ah  poor miss taylor   tis a sad business <end> 

 poor mr <end> and miss woodhouse  if you please  but i cannot possibly
say  poor miss taylor <end>  i have a great regard for you and emma 
but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence   at
any rate  it must be better to have only one to please than two <end> 

 especially when  one  of those two is such a fanciful  troublesome creature  
said emma playfully <end>   that is what you have in your head 
i know  and what you would certainly say if my father were not by <end> 

 i believe it is very true  my dear  indeed   said mr <end> woodhouse 
with a sigh <end>   i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome <end> 

 my dearest papa  you do not think i could mean  you   or suppose
mr <end> knightley to mean  you  <end>  what a horrible idea  oh no  i meant
only myself <end>  mr <end> knightley loves to find fault with me  you know  
in a joke  it is all a joke <end>  we always say what we like to one another <end> 

mr <end> knightley  in fact  was one of the few people who could see
faults in emma woodhouse  and the only one who ever told her of them 
and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself 
she knew it would be so much less so to her father  that she would
not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being
thought perfect by every body <end>

 emma knows i never flatter her   said mr <end> knightley   but i
meant no reflection on any body <end>  miss taylor has been used
to have two persons to please  she will now have but one <end>
the chances are that she must be a gainer <end> 

 well   said emma  willing to let it pass   you want to hear
about the wedding  and i shall be happy to tell you  for we all
behaved charmingly <end>  every body was punctual  every body in their
best looks  not a tear  and hardly a long face to be seen <end>  oh no 
we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart 
and were sure of meeting every day <end> 

 dear emma bears every thing so well   said her father <end>
 but  mr <end> knightley  she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor 
and i am sure she  will  miss her more than she thinks for <end> 

emma turned away her head  divided between tears and smiles <end>
 it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion  
said mr <end> knightley <end>   we should not like her so well as we do  sir 
if we could suppose it  but she knows how much the marriage is to
miss taylor s advantage  she knows how very acceptable it must be 
at miss taylor s time of life  to be settled in a home of her own 
and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision 
and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure <end>
every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily
married <end> 

 and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me   said emma 
 and a very considerable one  that i made the match myself <end>
i made the match  you know  four years ago  and to have it take place 
and be proved in the right  when so many people said mr <end> weston would
never marry again  may comfort me for any thing <end> 

mr <end> knightley shook his head at her <end>  her father fondly replied 
 ah  my dear  i wish you would not make matches and foretell things 
for whatever you say always comes to pass <end>  pray do not make any
more matches <end> 

 i promise you to make none for myself  papa  but i must  indeed 
for other people <end>  it is the greatest amusement in the world  and
after such success  you know   every body said that mr <end> weston would
never marry again <end>  oh dear  no  mr <end> weston  who had been a widower
so long  and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife 
so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his
friends here  always acceptable wherever he went  always cheerful  
mr <end> weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did
not like it <end>  oh no  mr <end> weston certainly would never marry again <end>
some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed 
and others of the son and the uncle not letting him <end>  all manner
of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject  but i believed none
of it <end>

 ever since the day  about four years ago  that miss taylor and i
met with him in broadway lane  when  because it began to drizzle 
he darted away with so much gallantry  and borrowed two umbrellas
for us from farmer mitchell s  i made up my mind on the subject <end>
i planned the match from that hour  and when such success has blessed
me in this instance  dear papa  you cannot think that i shall leave
off match making <end> 

 i do not understand what you mean by  success    said mr <end> knightley <end>
 success supposes endeavour <end>  your time has been properly and
delicately spent  if you have been endeavouring for the last four
years to bring about this marriage <end>  a worthy employment for a young
lady s mind  but if  which i rather imagine  your making the match 
as you call it  means only your planning it  your saying to yourself
one idle day   i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor
if mr <end> weston were to marry her   and saying it again to yourself
every now and then afterwards  why do you talk of success  where
is your merit  what are you proud of  you made a lucky guess 
and  that  is all that can be said <end> 

 and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess   
i pity you <end>  i thought you cleverer  for  depend upon it a lucky
guess is never merely luck <end>  there is always some talent in it <end>
and as to my poor word  success   which you quarrel with  i do not
know that i am so entirely without any claim to it <end>  you have drawn
two pretty pictures  but i think there may be a third  a something
between the do nothing and the do all <end> if i had not promoted mr <end> weston s
visits here  and given many little encouragements  and smoothed
many little matters  it might not have come to any thing after all <end>
i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that <end> 

 a straightforward  open hearted man like weston  and a rational 
unaffected woman like miss taylor  may be safely left to manage their
own concerns <end>  you are more likely to have done harm to yourself 
than good to them  by interference <end> 

 emma never thinks of herself  if she can do good to others  
rejoined mr <end> woodhouse  understanding but in part <end>   but  my dear 
pray do not make any more matches  they are silly things  and break up
one s family circle grievously <end> 

 only one more  papa  only for mr <end> elton <end>  poor mr <end> elton  you
like mr <end> elton  papa   i must look about for a wife for him <end>
there is nobody in highbury who deserves him  and he has been
here a whole year  and has fitted up his house so comfortably 
that it would be a shame to have him single any longer  and i thought
when he was joining their hands to day  he looked so very much as if
he would like to have the same kind office done for him  i think
very well of mr <end> elton  and this is the only way i have of doing
him a service <end> 

 mr <end> elton is a very pretty young man  to be sure  and a very
good young man  and i have a great regard for him <end>  but if you
want to shew him any attention  my dear  ask him to come
and dine with us some day <end>  that will be a much better thing <end>
i dare say mr <end> knightley will be so kind as to meet him <end> 

 with a great deal of pleasure  sir  at any time   said mr <end> knightley 
laughing   and i agree with you entirely  that it will be a much
better thing <end>  invite him to dinner  emma  and help him to the best
of the fish and the chicken  but leave him to chuse his own wife <end>
depend upon it  a man of six or seven and twenty can take care
of himself <end> 



chapter ii


mr <end> weston was a native of highbury  and born of a respectable family 
which for the last two or three generations had been rising into
gentility and property <end>  he had received a good education  but 
on succeeding early in life to a small independence  had become
indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers
were engaged  and had satisfied an active  cheerful mind and social
temper by entering into the militia of his county  then embodied <end>

captain weston was a general favourite  and when the chances
of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill 
of a great yorkshire family  and miss churchill fell in love
with him  nobody was surprized  except her brother and his wife 
who had never seen him  and who were full of pride and importance 
which the connexion would offend <end>

miss churchill  however  being of age  and with the full command
of her fortune  though her fortune bore no proportion to the
family estate  was not to be dissuaded from the marriage  and it
took place  to the infinite mortification of mr <end> and mrs <end> churchill 
who threw her off with due decorum <end>  it was an unsuitable connexion 
and did not produce much happiness <end>  mrs <end> weston ought to have found
more in it  for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper
made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness
of being in love with him  but though she had one sort of spirit 
she had not the best <end>  she had resolution enough to pursue
her own will in spite of her brother  but not enough to refrain
from unreasonable regrets at that brother s unreasonable anger 
nor from missing the luxuries of her former home <end>  they lived beyond
their income  but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe 
she did not cease to love her husband  but she wanted at once
to be the wife of captain weston  and miss churchill of enscombe <end>

captain weston  who had been considered  especially by the churchills 
as making such an amazing match  was proved to have much the worst
of the bargain  for when his wife died  after a three years  marriage 
he was rather a poorer man than at first  and with a child to maintain <end>
from the expense of the child  however  he was soon relieved <end>
the boy had  with the additional softening claim of a lingering
illness of his mother s  been the means of a sort of reconciliation 
and mr <end> and mrs <end> churchill  having no children of their own 
nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for  offered to
take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease <end>
some scruples and some reluctance the widower father may be supposed
to have felt  but as they were overcome by other considerations 
the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills 
and he had only his own comfort to seek  and his own situation to
improve as he could <end>

a complete change of life became desirable <end>  he quitted the militia
and engaged in trade  having brothers already established in a
good way in london  which afforded him a favourable opening <end>
it was a concern which brought just employment enough <end>  he had still
a small house in highbury  where most of his leisure days were spent 
and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society 
the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away <end>
he had  by that time  realised an easy competence  enough to secure
the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury  which he had
always longed for  enough to marry a woman as portionless even
as miss taylor  and to live according to the wishes of his own
friendly and social disposition <end>

it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence
his schemes  but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth
on youth  it had not shaken his determination of never settling
till he could purchase randalls  and the sale of randalls was long
looked forward to  but he had gone steadily on  with these objects
in view  till they were accomplished <end>  he had made his fortune 
bought his house  and obtained his wife  and was beginning a new
period of existence  with every probability of greater happiness
than in any yet passed through <end>  he had never been an unhappy man 
his own temper had secured him from that  even in his first marriage 
but his second must shew him how delightful a well judging and truly
amiable woman could be  and must give him the pleasantest proof
of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen 
to excite gratitude than to feel it <end>

he had only himself to please in his choice  his fortune was
his own  for as to frank  it was more than being tacitly brought
up as his uncle s heir  it had become so avowed an adoption
as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age <end>
it was most unlikely  therefore  that he should ever want his
father s assistance <end>  his father had no apprehension of it <end>
the aunt was a capricious woman  and governed her husband entirely 
but it was not in mr <end> weston s nature to imagine that any caprice
could be strong enough to affect one so dear  and  as he believed 
so deservedly dear <end>  he saw his son every year in london 
and was proud of him  and his fond report of him as a very fine
young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too <end>
he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his
merits and prospects a kind of common concern <end>

mr <end> frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury  and a lively
curiosity to see him prevailed  though the compliment was so little
returned that he had never been there in his life <end>  his coming
to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved <end>

now  upon his father s marriage  it was very generally proposed 
as a most proper attention  that the visit should take place <end>
there was not a dissentient voice on the subject  either when
mrs <end> perry drank tea with mrs <end> and miss bates  or when mrs <end> and
miss bates returned the visit <end>  now was the time for mr <end> frank
churchill to come among them  and the hope strengthened when it was
understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion <end>
for a few days  every morning visit in highbury included some mention
of the handsome letter mrs <end> weston had received <end>   i suppose you
have heard of the handsome letter mr <end> frank churchill has written
to mrs <end> weston  i understand it was a very handsome letter  indeed <end>
mr <end> woodhouse told me of it <end>  mr <end> woodhouse saw the letter  and he
says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life <end> 

it was  indeed  a highly prized letter <end>  mrs <end> weston had  of course 
formed a very favourable idea of the young man  and such a pleasing
attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense 
and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression
of congratulation which her marriage had already secured <end>  she felt
herself a most fortunate woman  and she had lived long enough
to know how fortunate she might well be thought  where the only
regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship
for her had never cooled  and who could ill bear to part with her <end>

she knew that at times she must be missed  and could not think 
without pain  of emma s losing a single pleasure  or suffering
an hour s ennui  from the want of her companionableness  but dear
emma was of no feeble character  she was more equal to her situation
than most girls would have been  and had sense  and energy 
and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily
through its little difficulties and privations <end>  and then there was
such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield 
so convenient for even solitary female walking  and in mr <end> weston s
disposition and circumstances  which would make the approaching
season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the
week together <end>

her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude
to mrs <end> weston  and of moments only of regret  and her
satisfaction  her more than satisfaction  her cheerful enjoyment 
was so just and so apparent  that emma  well as she knew her father 
was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity
 poor miss taylor   when they left her at randalls in the centre
of every domestic comfort  or saw her go away in the evening
attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own <end>
but never did she go without mr <end> woodhouse s giving a gentle sigh 
and saying   ah  poor miss taylor  she would be very glad to stay <end> 

there was no recovering miss taylor  nor much likelihood of
ceasing to pity her  but a few weeks brought some alleviation
to mr <end> woodhouse <end>  the compliments of his neighbours were over 
he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event 
and the wedding cake  which had been a great distress to him 
was all eat up <end>  his own stomach could bear nothing rich  and he
could never believe other people to be different from himself <end>
what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body 
and he had  therefore  earnestly tried to dissuade them from having
any wedding cake at all  and when that proved vain  as earnestly
tried to prevent any body s eating it <end>  he had been at the pains
of consulting mr <end> perry  the apothecary  on the subject <end>  mr <end> perry
was an intelligent  gentlemanlike man  whose frequent visits were one
of the comforts of mr <end> woodhouse s life  and upon being applied to 
he could not but acknowledge  though it seemed rather against the
bias of inclination  that wedding cake might certainly disagree
with many  perhaps with most people  unless taken moderately <end>
with such an opinion  in confirmation of his own  mr <end> woodhouse hoped
to influence every visitor of the newly married pair  but still the
cake was eaten  and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till
it was all gone <end>

there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys
being seen with a slice of mrs <end> weston s wedding cake in their
hands  but mr <end> woodhouse would never believe it <end>



chapter iii


mr <end> woodhouse was fond of society in his own way <end>  he liked very much
to have his friends come and see him  and from various united causes 
from his long residence at hartfield  and his good nature 
from his fortune  his house  and his daughter  he could command the
visits of his own little circle  in a great measure  as he liked <end>
he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle 
his horror of late hours  and large dinner parties  made him unfit
for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms <end>
fortunately for him  highbury  including randalls in the same parish 
and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining  the seat of mr <end> knightley 
comprehended many such <end>  not unfrequently  through emma s persuasion 
he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him  but evening
parties were what he preferred  and  unless he fancied himself at any
time unequal to company  there was scarcely an evening in the week
in which emma could not make up a card table for him <end>

real  long standing regard brought the westons and mr <end> knightley 
and by mr <end> elton  a young man living alone without liking it 
the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude
for the elegancies and society of mr <end> woodhouse s drawing room 
and the smiles of his lovely daughter  was in no danger of being
thrown away <end>

after these came a second set  among the most come at able
of whom were mrs <end> and miss bates  and mrs <end> goddard  three ladies
almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield 
and who were fetched and carried home so often  that mr <end> woodhouse
thought it no hardship for either james or the horses <end>  had it
taken place only once a year  it would have been a grievance <end>

mrs <end> bates  the widow of a former vicar of highbury  was a
very old lady  almost past every thing but tea and quadrille <end>
she lived with her single daughter in a very small way  and was
considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady 
under such untoward circumstances  can excite <end>  her daughter enjoyed
a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young 
handsome  rich  nor married <end>  miss bates stood in the very worst
predicament in the world for having much of the public favour 
and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself 
or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect <end>
she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness <end>  her youth
had passed without distinction  and her middle of life was devoted
to the care of a failing mother  and the endeavour to make a small
income go as far as possible <end>  and yet she was a happy woman 
and a woman whom no one named without good will <end>  it was her own
universal good will and contented temper which worked such wonders <end>
she loved every body  was interested in every body s happiness 
quicksighted to every body s merits  thought herself a most fortunate
creature  and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother 
and so many good neighbours and friends  and a home that wanted
for nothing <end>  the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature 
her contented and grateful spirit  were a recommendation to every body 
and a mine of felicity to herself <end>  she was a great talker upon
little matters  which exactly suited mr <end> woodhouse  full of trivial
communications and harmless gossip <end>

mrs <end> goddard was the mistress of a school  not of a seminary 
or an establishment  or any thing which professed  in long sentences of
refined nonsense  to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality 
upon new principles and new systems  and where young ladies for
enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity  but
a real  honest  old fashioned boarding school  where a reasonable
quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price 
and where girls might be sent to be out of the way  and scramble
themselves into a little education  without any danger of coming
back prodigies <end>  mrs <end> goddard s school was in high repute  and
very deservedly  for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy
spot  she had an ample house and garden  gave the children plenty
of wholesome food  let them run about a great deal in the summer 
and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands <end>
it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked
after her to church <end>  she was a plain  motherly kind of woman 
who had worked hard in her youth  and now thought herself entitled
to the occasional holiday of a tea visit  and having formerly
owed much to mr <end> woodhouse s kindness  felt his particular claim
on her to leave her neat parlour  hung round with fancy work 
whenever she could  and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside <end>

these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently
able to collect  and happy was she  for her father s sake 
in the power  though  as far as she was herself concerned 
it was no remedy for the absence of mrs <end> weston <end>  she was delighted
to see her father look comfortable  and very much pleased with
herself for contriving things so well  but the quiet prosings
of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent
was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated <end>

as she sat one morning  looking forward to exactly such a close
of the present day  a note was brought from mrs <end> goddard  requesting 
in most respectful terms  to be allowed to bring miss smith with her 
a most welcome request  for miss smith was a girl of seventeen 
whom emma knew very well by sight  and had long felt an interest in 
on account of her beauty <end>  a very gracious invitation was returned 
and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion <end>

harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody <end>  somebody had
placed her  several years back  at mrs <end> goddard s school 
and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar
to that of parlour boarder <end> this was all that was generally known
of her history <end>  she had no visible friends but what had been
acquired at highbury  and was now just returned from a long visit
in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her <end>

she was a very pretty girl  and her beauty happened to be of a sort
which emma particularly admired <end>  she was short  plump  and fair 
with a fine bloom  blue eyes  light hair  regular features 
and a look of great sweetness  and  before the end of the evening 
emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person  and quite
determined to continue the acquaintance <end>

she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith s
conversation  but she found her altogether very engaging  not
inconveniently shy  not unwilling to talk  and yet so far from pushing 
shewing so proper and becoming a deference  seeming so pleasantly
grateful for being admitted to hartfield  and so artlessly
impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style
to what she had been used to  that she must have good sense 
and deserve encouragement <end>  encouragement should be given <end>
those soft blue eyes  and all those natural graces  should not be
wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions <end>
the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her <end>
the friends from whom she had just parted  though very good sort
of people  must be doing her harm <end>  they were a family of the name
of martin  whom emma well knew by character  as renting a large farm
of mr <end> knightley  and residing in the parish of donwell  very creditably 
she believed  she knew mr <end> knightley thought highly of them  but they
must be coarse and unpolished  and very unfit to be the intimates
of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance
to be quite perfect <end>   she  would notice her  she would improve her 
she would detach her from her bad acquaintance  and introduce her
into good society  she would form her opinions and her manners <end>
it would be an interesting  and certainly a very kind undertaking 
highly becoming her own situation in life  her leisure  and powers <end>

she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes  in talking
and listening  and forming all these schemes in the in betweens  that
the evening flew away at a very unusual rate  and the supper table 
which always closed such parties  and for which she had been
used to sit and watch the due time  was all set out and ready 
and moved forwards to the fire  before she was aware <end>  with an
alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never
indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively 
with the real good will of a mind delighted with its own ideas 
did she then do all the honours of the meal  and help and recommend
the minced chicken and scalloped oysters  with an urgency which she
knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests <end>

upon such occasions poor mr <end> woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare <end>
he loved to have the cloth laid  because it had been the fashion
of his youth  but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome
made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it  and while his
hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing 
his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat <end>

such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that
he could  with thorough self approbation  recommend  though he
might constrain himself  while the ladies were comfortably clearing
the nicer things  to say 

 mrs <end> bates  let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs <end>
an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome <end>  serle understands boiling
an egg better than any body <end>  i would not recommend an egg boiled
by any body else  but you need not be afraid  they are very small 
you see  one of our small eggs will not hurt you <end>  miss bates 
let emma help you to a  little  bit of tart  a  very  little bit <end>
ours are all apple tarts <end> you need not be afraid of unwholesome
preserves here <end>  i do not advise the custard <end>  mrs <end> goddard  what say
you to  half  a glass of wine  a  small  half glass  put into a tumbler
of water  i do not think it could disagree with you <end> 

emma allowed her father to talk  but supplied her visitors in
a much more satisfactory style  and on the present evening had
particular pleasure in sending them away happy <end>  the happiness
of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions <end>  miss woodhouse
was so great a personage in highbury  that the prospect of the
introduction had given as much panic as pleasure  but the humble 
grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings 
delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated
her all the evening  and actually shaken hands with her at last 



chapter iv


harriet smith s intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing <end>
quick and decided in her ways  emma lost no time in inviting  encouraging 
and telling her to come very often  and as their acquaintance increased 
so did their satisfaction in each other <end>  as a walking companion 
emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her <end>
in that respect mrs <end> weston s loss had been important <end>  her father
never went beyond the shrubbery  where two divisions of the ground
sufficed him for his long walk  or his short  as the year varied 
and since mrs <end> weston s marriage her exercise had been too much confined <end>
she had ventured once alone to randalls  but it was not pleasant 
and a harriet smith  therefore  one whom she could summon at any
time to a walk  would be a valuable addition to her privileges <end>
but in every respect  as she saw more of her  she approved her 
and was confirmed in all her kind designs <end>

harriet certainly was not clever  but she had a sweet  docile 
grateful disposition  was totally free from conceit  and only desiring
to be guided by any one she looked up to <end>  her early attachment
to herself was very amiable  and her inclination for good company 
and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever  shewed that
there was no want of taste  though strength of understanding must
not be expected <end>  altogether she was quite convinced of harriet
smith s being exactly the young friend she wanted  exactly the
something which her home required <end>  such a friend as mrs <end> weston
was out of the question <end>  two such could never be granted <end>
two such she did not want <end>  it was quite a different sort of thing 
a sentiment distinct and independent <end>  mrs <end> weston was the object
of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem <end>
harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful <end>
for mrs <end> weston there was nothing to be done  for harriet every thing <end>

her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who
were the parents  but harriet could not tell <end>  she was ready to tell
every thing in her power  but on this subject questions were vain <end>
emma was obliged to fancy what she liked  but she could never
believe that in the same situation  she  should not have discovered
the truth <end>  harriet had no penetration <end>  she had been satisfied
to hear and believe just what mrs <end> goddard chose to tell her 
and looked no farther <end>

mrs <end> goddard  and the teachers  and the girls and the affairs of the
school in general  formed naturally a great part of the conversation  and
but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey mill farm 
it must have been the whole <end>  but the martins occupied her thoughts
a good deal  she had spent two very happy months with them 
and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit  and describe
the many comforts and wonders of the place <end>  emma encouraged her
talkativeness  amused by such a picture of another set of beings 
and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much
exultation of mrs <end> martin s having   two  parlours  two very good parlours 
indeed  one of them quite as large as mrs <end> goddard s drawing room 
and of her having an upper maid who had lived five and twenty years
with her  and of their having eight cows  two of them alderneys 
and one a little welch cow  a very pretty little welch cow indeed 
and of mrs <end> martin s saying as she was so fond of it  it should be
called  her  cow  and of their having a very handsome summer house
in their garden  where some day next year they were all to drink
tea   a very handsome summer house  large enough to hold a dozen people <end> 

for some time she was amused  without thinking beyond the immediate cause 
but as she came to understand the family better  other feelings arose <end>
she had taken up a wrong idea  fancying it was a mother and daughter 
a son and son s wife  who all lived together  but when it appeared
that the mr <end> martin  who bore a part in the narrative  and was always
mentioned with approbation for his great good nature in doing something
or other  was a single man  that there was no young mrs <end> martin 
no wife in the case  she did suspect danger to her poor little
friend from all this hospitality and kindness  and that  if she
were not taken care of  she might be required to sink herself forever <end>

with this inspiriting notion  her questions increased in number
and meaning  and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr <end> martin 
and there was evidently no dislike to it <end>  harriet was very ready
to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry
evening games  and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good humoured
and obliging <end>  he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring
her some walnuts  because she had said how fond she was of them 
and in every thing else he was so very obliging <end>  he had his
shepherd s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her <end>
she was very fond of singing <end>  he could sing a little himself <end>
she believed he was very clever  and understood every thing <end>
he had a very fine flock  and  while she was with them 
he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country <end>
she believed every body spoke well of him <end>  his mother and sisters
were very fond of him <end>  mrs <end> martin had told her one day  and there
was a blush as she said it   that it was impossible for any body
to be a better son  and therefore she was sure  whenever he married 
he would make a good husband <end>  not that she  wanted  him to marry <end>
she was in no hurry at all <end>

 well done  mrs <end> martin   thought emma <end>   you know what you are about <end> 

 and when she had come away  mrs <end> martin was so very kind as to send
mrs <end> goddard a beautiful goose  the finest goose mrs <end> goddard had
ever seen <end>  mrs <end> goddard had dressed it on a sunday  and asked all
the three teachers  miss nash  and miss prince  and miss richardson 
to sup with her <end> 

 mr <end> martin  i suppose  is not a man of information beyond the line
of his own business  he does not read  

 oh yes   that is  no  i do not know  but i believe he has
read a good deal  but not what you would think any thing of <end>
he reads the agricultural reports  and some other books that lay
in one of the window seats  but he reads all  them  to himself <end>
but sometimes of an evening  before we went to cards  he would read
something aloud out of the elegant extracts  very entertaining <end>
and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield <end>  he never read the
romance of the forest  nor the children of the abbey <end>  he had never
heard of such books before i mentioned them  but he is determined
to get them now as soon as ever he can <end> 

the next question was  

 what sort of looking man is mr <end> martin  

 oh  not handsome  not at all handsome <end>  i thought him very plain
at first  but i do not think him so plain now <end>  one does not  you know 
after a time <end>  but did you never see him  he is in highbury every
now and then  and he is sure to ride through every week in his way
to kingston <end>  he has passed you very often <end> 

 that may be  and i may have seen him fifty times  but without
having any idea of his name <end>  a young farmer  whether on horseback
or on foot  is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity <end>
the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i
can have nothing to do <end>  a degree or two lower  and a creditable
appearance might interest me  i might hope to be useful to their
families in some way or other <end>  but a farmer can need none of my help 
and is  therefore  in one sense  as much above my notice as in every
other he is below it <end> 

 to be sure <end>  oh yes  it is not likely you should ever have
observed him  but he knows you very well indeed  i mean by sight <end> 

 i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man <end>
i know  indeed  that he is so  and  as such  wish him well <end>
what do you imagine his age to be  

 he was four and twenty the 8th of last june  and my birthday is
the 23rd just a fortnight and a day s difference  which is very odd <end> 

 only four and twenty <end> that is too young to settle <end>  his mother is
perfectly right not to be in a hurry <end>  they seem very comfortable
as they are  and if she were to take any pains to marry him 
she would probably repent it <end>  six years hence  if he could meet
with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own 
with a little money  it might be very desirable <end> 

 six years hence  dear miss woodhouse  he would be thirty years old  

 well  and that is as early as most men can afford to marry 
who are not born to an independence <end>  mr <end> martin  i imagine 
has his fortune entirely to make  cannot be at all beforehand with
the world <end>  whatever money he might come into when his father died 
whatever his share of the family property  it is  i dare say 
all afloat  all employed in his stock  and so forth  and though 
with diligence and good luck  he may be rich in time  it is next to
impossible that he should have realised any thing yet <end> 

 to be sure  so it is <end>  but they live very comfortably <end>
they have no indoors man  else they do not want for any thing 
and mrs <end> martin talks of taking a boy another year <end> 

 i wish you may not get into a scrape  harriet  whenever he does
marry   i mean  as to being acquainted with his wife  for though
his sisters  from a superior education  are not to be altogether
objected to  it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit
for you to notice <end>  the misfortune of your birth ought to make you
particularly careful as to your associates <end>  there can be no doubt
of your being a gentleman s daughter  and you must support your
claim to that station by every thing within your own power  or there
will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you <end> 

 yes  to be sure  i suppose there are <end>  but while i visit
at hartfield  and you are so kind to me  miss woodhouse 
i am not afraid of what any body can do <end> 

 you understand the force of influence pretty well  harriet  but i
would have you so firmly established in good society  as to be
independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse <end>  i want to see you
permanently well connected  and to that end it will be advisable
to have as few odd acquaintance as may be  and  therefore  i say
that if you should still be in this country when mr <end> martin marries 
i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters 
to be acquainted with the wife  who will probably be some mere
farmer s daughter  without education <end> 

 to be sure <end>  yes <end>  not that i think mr <end> martin would ever marry any body
but what had had some education  and been very well brought up <end>
however  i do not mean to set up my opinion against your s  and i
am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife <end>  i shall
always have a great regard for the miss martins  especially elizabeth 
and should be very sorry to give them up  for they are quite as well
educated as me <end>  but if he marries a very ignorant  vulgar woman 
certainly i had better not visit her  if i can help it <end> 

emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech 
and saw no alarming symptoms of love <end>  the young man had been
the first admirer  but she trusted there was no other hold 
and that there would be no serious difficulty  on harriet s side 
to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own <end>

they met mr <end> martin the very next day  as they were walking on the
donwell road <end>  he was on foot  and after looking very respectfully
at her  looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion <end>
emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey 
and walking a few yards forward  while they talked together  soon made
her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr <end> robert martin <end>
his appearance was very neat  and he looked like a sensible young man 
but his person had no other advantage  and when he came to be
contrasted with gentlemen  she thought he must lose all the ground
he had gained in harriet s inclination <end>  harriet was not insensible
of manner  she had voluntarily noticed her father s gentleness
with admiration as well as wonder <end>  mr <end> martin looked as if he
did not know what manner was <end>

they remained but a few minutes together  as miss woodhouse must
not be kept waiting  and harriet then came running to her with a
smiling face  and in a flutter of spirits  which miss woodhouse
hoped very soon to compose <end>

 only think of our happening to meet him   how very odd  it was
quite a chance  he said  that he had not gone round by randalls <end>
he did not think we ever walked this road <end>  he thought we walked
towards randalls most days <end>  he has not been able to get the
romance of the forest yet <end>  he was so busy the last time he was
at kingston that he quite forgot it  but he goes again to morrow <end>
so very odd we should happen to meet  well  miss woodhouse  is he
like what you expected  what do you think of him  do you think him
so very plain  

 he is very plain  undoubtedly  remarkably plain   but that is
nothing compared with his entire want of gentility <end>  i had no
right to expect much  and i did not expect much  but i had no
idea that he could be so very clownish  so totally without air <end>
i had imagined him  i confess  a degree or two nearer gentility <end> 

 to be sure   said harriet  in a mortified voice   he is not
so genteel as real gentlemen <end> 

 i think  harriet  since your acquaintance with us  you have been
repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen 
that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr <end> martin <end>
at hartfield  you have had very good specimens of well educated 
well bred men <end>  i should be surprized if  after seeing them 
you could be in company with mr <end> martin again without perceiving
him to be a very inferior creature  and rather wondering at
yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before <end>
do not you begin to feel that now  were not you struck  i am sure
you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner 
and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated
as i stood here <end> 

 certainly  he is not like mr <end> knightley <end>  he has not such a fine
air and way of walking as mr <end> knightley <end>  i see the difference
plain enough <end>  but mr <end> knightley is so very fine a man  

 mr <end> knightley s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair
to compare mr <end> martin with  him  <end>  you might not see one in a hundred
with  gentleman  so plainly written as in mr <end> knightley <end>  but he is
not the only gentleman you have been lately used to <end>  what say you
to mr <end> weston and mr <end> elton  compare mr <end> martin with either of  them  <end>
compare their manner of carrying themselves  of walking  of speaking 
of being silent <end>  you must see the difference <end> 

 oh yes   there is a great difference <end>  but mr <end> weston is almost
an old man <end>  mr <end> weston must be between forty and fifty <end> 

 which makes his good manners the more valuable <end>  the older a
person grows  harriet  the more important it is that their manners
should not be bad  the more glaring and disgusting any loudness 
or coarseness  or awkwardness becomes <end>  what is passable in youth
is detestable in later age <end>  mr <end> martin is now awkward and abrupt 
what will he be at mr <end> weston s time of life  

 there is no saying  indeed   replied harriet rather solemnly <end>

 but there may be pretty good guessing <end>  he will be a completely gross 
vulgar farmer  totally inattentive to appearances  and thinking
of nothing but profit and loss <end> 

 will he  indeed  that will be very bad <end> 

 how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the
circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended <end>
he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing
else  which is just as it should be  for a thriving man <end>  what has
he to do with books  and i have no doubt that he  will  thrive 
and be a very rich man in time  and his being illiterate and coarse
need not disturb  us  <end> 

 i wonder he did not remember the book   was all harriet s answer 
and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might
be safely left to itself <end>  she  therefore  said no more for some time <end>
her next beginning was 

 in one respect  perhaps  mr <end> elton s manners are superior
to mr <end> knightley s or mr <end> weston s <end> they have more gentleness <end>
they might be more safely held up as a pattern <end>  there is an openness 
a quickness  almost a bluntness in mr <end> weston  which every body
likes in  him   because there is so much good humour with it  but
that would not do to be copied <end>  neither would mr <end> knightley s
downright  decided  commanding sort of manner  though it suits
 him  very well  his figure  and look  and situation in life seem
to allow it  but if any young man were to set about copying him 
he would not be sufferable <end>  on the contrary  i think a young man
might be very safely recommended to take mr <end> elton as a model <end>
mr <end> elton is good humoured  cheerful  obliging  and gentle <end>
he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late <end>  i do not
know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either
of us  harriet  by additional softness  but it strikes me that his
manners are softer than they used to be <end>  if he means any thing 
it must be to please you <end>  did not i tell you what he said of you
the other day  

she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn
from mr <end> elton  and now did full justice to  and harriet blushed
and smiled  and said she had always thought mr <end> elton very agreeable <end>

mr <end> elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving
the young farmer out of harriet s head <end>  she thought it would
be an excellent match  and only too palpably desirable  natural 
and probable  for her to have much merit in planning it <end>
she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict <end>
it was not likely  however  that any body should have equalled
her in the date of the plan  as it had entered her brain during
the very first evening of harriet s coming to hartfield <end>  the longer
she considered it  the greater was her sense of its expediency <end>
mr <end> elton s situation was most suitable  quite the gentleman himself 
and without low connexions  at the same time  not of any family
that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet <end>  he had a
comfortable home for her  and emma imagined a very sufficient income 
for though the vicarage of highbury was not large  he was known
to have some independent property  and she thought very highly
of him as a good humoured  well meaning  respectable young man 
without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world <end>

she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful
girl  which she trusted  with such frequent meetings at hartfield 
was foundation enough on his side  and on harriet s there could be
little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all
the usual weight and efficacy <end>  and he was really a very pleasing
young man  a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like <end>
he was reckoned very handsome  his person much admired in general 
though not by her  there being a want of elegance of feature which
she could not dispense with   but the girl who could be gratified
by a robert martin s riding about the country to get walnuts
for her might very well be conquered by mr <end> elton s admiration <end>



chapter v


 i do not know what your opinion may be  mrs <end> weston   said mr <end> knightley   of
this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith  but i think it a bad thing <end> 

 a bad thing  do you really think it a bad thing   why so  

 i think they will neither of them do the other any good <end> 

 you surprize me  emma must do harriet good  and by supplying her
with a new object of interest  harriet may be said to do emma good <end>
i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure <end>
how very differently we feel   not think they will do each other any
good  this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels
about emma  mr <end> knightley <end> 

 perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you 
knowing weston to be out  and that you must still fight your own battle <end> 

 mr <end> weston would undoubtedly support me  if he were here 
for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject <end>  we were speaking
of it only yesterday  and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma 
that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with <end>
mr <end> knightley  i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case <end>
you are so much used to live alone  that you do not know the value
of a companion  and  perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort
a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex  after being used
to it all her life <end>  i can imagine your objection to harriet smith <end>
she is not the superior young woman which emma s friend ought to be <end>
but on the other hand  as emma wants to see her better informed 
it will be an inducement to her to read more herself <end>  they will
read together <end>  she means it  i know <end> 

 emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve
years old <end>  i have seen a great many lists of her drawing up at
various times of books that she meant to read regularly through  and
very good lists they were  very well chosen  and very neatly
arranged  sometimes alphabetically  and sometimes by some other rule <end>
the list she drew up when only fourteen  i remember thinking it
did her judgment so much credit  that i preserved it some time 
and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now <end>  but i
have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma <end>
she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience 
and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding <end>  where miss taylor
failed to stimulate  i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do
nothing <end>  you never could persuade her to read half so much as you
wished <end>  you know you could not <end> 

 i dare say   replied mrs <end> weston  smiling   that i thought
so  then    but since we have parted  i can never remember emma s
omitting to do any thing i wished <end> 

 there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as  that     said
mr <end> knightley  feelingly  and for a moment or two he had done <end>   but i  
he soon added   who have had no such charm thrown over my senses 
must still see  hear  and remember <end>  emma is spoiled by being the
cleverest of her family <end>  at ten years old  she had the misfortune of
being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen <end>
she was always quick and assured  isabella slow and diffident <end>
and ever since she was twelve  emma has been mistress of the house
and of you all <end>  in her mother she lost the only person able to cope
with her <end>  she inherits her mother s talents  and must have been
under subjection to her <end> 

 i should have been sorry  mr <end> knightley  to be dependent on
 your  recommendation  had i quitted mr <end> woodhouse s family and wanted
another situation  i do not think you would have spoken a good word for
me to any body <end>  i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held <end> 

 yes   said he  smiling <end>   you are better placed  here   very fit
for a wife  but not at all for a governess <end>  but you were preparing
yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield <end>
you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would
seem to promise  but you were receiving a very good education from  her  
on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will 
and doing as you were bid  and if weston had asked me to recommend
him a wife  i should certainly have named miss taylor <end> 

 thank you <end>  there will be very little merit in making a good wife
to such a man as mr <end> weston <end> 

 why  to own the truth  i am afraid you are rather thrown away 
and that with every disposition to bear  there will be nothing
to be borne <end>  we will not despair  however <end>  weston may grow cross
from the wantonness of comfort  or his son may plague him <end> 

 i hope not  that  <end>  it is not likely <end>  no  mr <end> knightley  do not
foretell vexation from that quarter <end> 

 not i  indeed <end>  i only name possibilities <end>  i do not pretend to emma s
genius for foretelling and guessing <end>  i hope  with all my heart 
the young man may be a weston in merit  and a churchill in fortune <end>  but
harriet smith  i have not half done about harriet smith <end>  i think
her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have <end>
she knows nothing herself  and looks upon emma as knowing every thing <end>
she is a flatterer in all her ways  and so much the worse 
because undesigned <end>  her ignorance is hourly flattery <end>  how can
emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself  while harriet
is presenting such a delightful inferiority  and as for harriet 
i will venture to say that  she  cannot gain by the acquaintance <end>
hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places
she belongs to <end>  she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable
with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home <end>
i am much mistaken if emma s doctrines give any strength of mind 
or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties
of her situation in life <end>  they only give a little polish <end> 

 i either depend more upon emma s good sense than you do  or am more
anxious for her present comfort  for i cannot lament the acquaintance <end>
how well she looked last night  

 oh  you would rather talk of her person than her mind  would you 
very well  i shall not attempt to deny emma s being pretty <end> 

 pretty  say beautiful rather <end>  can you imagine any thing nearer
perfect beauty than emma altogether  face and figure  

 i do not know what i could imagine  but i confess that i have
seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers <end>
but i am a partial old friend <end> 

 such an eye   the true hazle eye  and so brilliant  regular features 
open countenance  with a complexion  oh  what a bloom of full health 
and such a pretty height and size  such a firm and upright figure 
there is health  not merely in her bloom  but in her air  her head 
her glance <end>  one hears sometimes of a child being  the picture
of health   now  emma always gives me the idea of being the complete
picture of grown up health <end>  she is loveliness itself <end>  mr <end> knightley 
is not she  

 i have not a fault to find with her person   he replied <end>
 i think her all you describe <end>  i love to look at her  and i
will add this praise  that i do not think her personally vain <end>
considering how very handsome she is  she appears to be little
occupied with it  her vanity lies another way <end>  mrs <end> weston  i am
not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith  or my dread
of its doing them both harm <end> 

 and i  mr <end> knightley  am equally stout in my confidence of its
not doing them any harm <end>  with all dear emma s little faults 
she is an excellent creature <end>  where shall we see a better daughter 
or a kinder sister  or a truer friend  no  no  she has qualities
which may be trusted  she will never lead any one really wrong 
she will make no lasting blunder  where emma errs once  she is in the
right a hundred times <end> 

 very well  i will not plague you any more <end>  emma shall be an angel 
and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john
and isabella <end>  john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore
not a blind affection  and isabella always thinks as he does 
except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children <end>
i am sure of having their opinions with me <end> 

 i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind 
but excuse me  mr <end> knightley  if i take the liberty  i consider myself 
you know  as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma s
mother might have had  the liberty of hinting that i do not think
any possible good can arise from harriet smith s intimacy being made
a matter of much discussion among you <end>  pray excuse me  but supposing
any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy 
it cannot be expected that emma  accountable to nobody but her father 
who perfectly approves the acquaintance  should put an end to it 
so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself <end>  it has been so
many years my province to give advice  that you cannot be surprized 
mr <end> knightley  at this little remains of office <end> 

 not at all   cried he   i am much obliged to you for it <end>
it is very good advice  and it shall have a better fate than your
advice has often found  for it shall be attended to <end> 

 mrs <end> john knightley is easily alarmed  and might be made unhappy
about her sister <end> 

 be satisfied   said he   i will not raise any outcry <end>  i will keep
my ill humour to myself <end>  i have a very sincere interest in emma <end>
isabella does not seem more my sister  has never excited a
greater interest  perhaps hardly so great <end>  there is an anxiety 
a curiosity in what one feels for emma <end>  i wonder what will become
of her  

 so do i   said mrs <end> weston gently   very much <end> 

 she always declares she will never marry  which  of course 
means just nothing at all <end>  but i have no idea that she has yet
ever seen a man she cared for <end>  it would not be a bad thing for her
to be very much in love with a proper object <end>  i should like to see
emma in love  and in some doubt of a return  it would do her good <end>
but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her  and she goes so seldom
from home <end> 

 there does  indeed  seem as little to tempt her to break
her resolution at present   said mrs <end> weston   as can well be 
and while she is so happy at hartfield  i cannot wish her to be
forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties
on poor mr <end> woodhouse s account <end>  i do not recommend matrimony
at present to emma  though i mean no slight to the state  i assure you <end> 

part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of
her own and mr <end> weston s on the subject  as much as possible <end>
there were wishes at randalls respecting emma s destiny  but it
was not desirable to have them suspected  and the quiet transition
which mr <end> knightley soon afterwards made to  what does weston
think of the weather  shall we have rain   convinced her that he
had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield <end>



chapter vi


emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriet s fancy
a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity
to a very good purpose  for she found her decidedly more sensible
than before of mr <end> elton s being a remarkably handsome man  with most
agreeable manners  and as she had no hesitation in following up
the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints  she was soon
pretty confident of creating as much liking on harriet s side 
as there could be any occasion for <end>  she was quite convinced
of mr <end> elton s being in the fairest way of falling in love 
if not in love already <end>  she had no scruple with regard to him <end>
he talked of harriet  and praised her so warmly  that she could
not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add <end>
his perception of the striking improvement of harriet s manner 
since her introduction at hartfield  was not one of the least
agreeable proofs of his growing attachment <end>

 you have given miss smith all that she required   said he 
 you have made her graceful and easy <end>  she was a beautiful creature
when she came to you  but  in my opinion  the attractions you have
added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature <end> 

 i am glad you think i have been useful to her  but harriet
only wanted drawing out  and receiving a few  very few hints <end>
she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness
in herself <end>  i have done very little <end> 

 if it were admissible to contradict a lady   said the gallant
mr <end> elton  

 i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character 
have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her
way before <end> 

 exactly so  that is what principally strikes me <end>  so much superadded
decision of character  skilful has been the hand  

 great has been the pleasure  i am sure <end>  i never met with
a disposition more truly amiable <end> 

 i have no doubt of it <end>  and it was spoken with a sort
of sighing animation  which had a vast deal of the lover <end>
she was not less pleased another day with the manner
in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers  to have harriet s picture <end>

 did you ever have your likeness taken  harriet   said she   did
you ever sit for your picture  

harriet was on the point of leaving the room  and only stopt to say 
with a very interesting naivete 

 oh  dear  no  never <end> 

no sooner was she out of sight  than emma exclaimed 

 what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be  i would
give any money for it <end>  i almost long to attempt her likeness myself <end>
you do not know it i dare say  but two or three years ago i had
a great passion for taking likenesses  and attempted several of
my friends  and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general <end>
but from one cause or another  i gave it up in disgust <end>
but really  i could almost venture  if harriet would sit to me <end>
it would be such a delight to have her picture  

 let me entreat you   cried mr <end> elton   it would indeed be a delight 
let me entreat you  miss woodhouse  to exercise so charming a
talent in favour of your friend <end>  i know what your drawings are <end>
how could you suppose me ignorant  is not this room rich in
specimens of your landscapes and flowers  and has not mrs <end> weston
some inimitable figure pieces in her drawing room  at randalls  

yes  good man   thought emma  but what has all that to do with taking
likenesses  you know nothing of drawing <end>  don t pretend to be
in raptures about mine <end>  keep your raptures for harriet s face <end>
 well  if you give me such kind encouragement  mr <end> elton  i believe
i shall try what i can do <end>  harriet s features are very delicate 
which makes a likeness difficult  and yet there is a peculiarity
in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought
to catch <end> 

 exactly so  the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth  i
have not a doubt of your success <end>  pray  pray attempt it <end>
as you will do it  it will indeed  to use your own words 
be an exquisite possession <end> 

 but i am afraid  mr <end> elton  harriet will not like to sit <end>
she thinks so little of her own beauty <end>  did not you observe her
manner of answering me  how completely it meant   why should my
picture be drawn   

 oh  yes  i observed it  i assure you <end>  it was not lost on me <end>
but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded <end> 

harriet was soon back again  and the proposal almost immediately made 
and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest
pressing of both the others <end>  emma wished to go to work directly 
and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts
at portraits  for not one of them had ever been finished  that they
might decide together on the best size for harriet <end>  her many
beginnings were displayed <end>  miniatures  half lengths  whole lengths 
pencil  crayon  and water colours had been all tried in turn <end>
she had always wanted to do every thing  and had made more progress
both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little
labour as she would ever submit to <end>  she played and sang   and drew
in almost every style  but steadiness had always been wanting 
and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she
would have been glad to command  and ought not to have failed of <end>
she was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist
or a musician  but she was not unwilling to have others deceived 
or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher
than it deserved <end>

there was merit in every drawing  in the least finished  perhaps the most 
her style was spirited  but had there been much less  or had there
been ten times more  the delight and admiration of her two companions
would have been the same <end>  they were both in ecstasies <end>  a likeness
pleases every body  and miss woodhouse s performances must be capital <end>

 no great variety of faces for you   said emma <end>   i had only my
own family to study from <end>  there is my father  another of my
father  but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous 
that i could only take him by stealth  neither of them very
like therefore <end>  mrs <end> weston again  and again  and again  you see <end>
dear mrs <end> weston  always my kindest friend on every occasion <end>
she would sit whenever i asked her <end>  there is my sister  and really
quite her own little elegant figure   and the face not unlike <end>
i should have made a good likeness of her  if she would have
sat longer  but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four
children that she would not be quiet <end>  then  here come all my
attempts at three of those four children   there they are 
henry and john and bella  from one end of the sheet to the other 
and any one of them might do for any one of the rest <end>  she was so
eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse  but there is no
making children of three or four years old stand still you know 
nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them  beyond the
air and complexion  unless they are coarser featured than any
of mama s children ever were <end>  here is my sketch of the fourth 
who was a baby <end>  i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa  and it
is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see <end>
he had nestled down his head most conveniently <end>  that s very like <end>
i am rather proud of little george <end>  the corner of the sofa is very good <end>
then here is my last    unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman
in small size  whole length   my last and my best  my brother 
mr <end> john knightley <end>  this did not want much of being finished  when i
put it away in a pet  and vowed i would never take another likeness <end>
i could not help being provoked  for after all my pains  and when i
had really made a very good likeness of it   mrs <end> weston and i
were quite agreed in thinking it  very  like   only too handsome  too
flattering  but that was a fault on the right side  after
all this  came poor dear isabella s cold approbation of   yes 
it was a little like  but to be sure it did not do him justice <end> 
we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all <end>
it was made a great favour of  and altogether it was more than i
could bear  and so i never would finish it  to have it apologised
over as an unfavourable likeness  to every morning visitor in
brunswick square   and  as i said  i did then forswear ever drawing
any body again <end>  but for harriet s sake  or rather for my own 
and as there are no husbands and wives in the case  at   present  
i will break my resolution now <end> 

mr <end> elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea 
and was repeating   no husbands and wives in the case at present
indeed  as you observe <end>  exactly so <end>  no husbands and wives  
with so interesting a consciousness  that emma began to consider
whether she had not better leave them together at once <end>  but as she
wanted to be drawing  the declaration must wait a little longer <end>

she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait <end>
it was to be a whole length in water colours  like mr <end> john
knightley s  and was destined  if she could please herself 
to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece <end>

the sitting began  and harriet  smiling and blushing  and afraid
of not keeping her attitude and countenance  presented a very sweet
mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist <end>
but there was no doing any thing  with mr <end> elton fidgeting behind
her and watching every touch <end>  she gave him credit for stationing
himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence 
but was really obliged to put an end to it  and request him to
place himself elsewhere <end>  it then occurred to her to employ him
in reading <end>

 if he would be so good as to read to them  it would be a kindness
indeed  it would amuse away the difficulties of her part  and lessen
the irksomeness of miss smith s <end> 

mr <end> elton was only too happy <end>  harriet listened  and emma drew
in peace <end>  she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look 
any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover 
and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil 
to jump up and see the progress  and be charmed <end>  there was no
being displeased with such an encourager  for his admiration
made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible <end>
she could not respect his eye  but his love and his complaisance
were unexceptionable <end>

the sitting was altogether very satisfactory  she was quite
enough pleased with the first day s sketch to wish to go on <end>
there was no want of likeness  she had been fortunate in the attitude 
and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure 
to give a little more height  and considerably more elegance  she had
great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last 
and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both  a
standing memorial of the beauty of one  the skill of the other 
and the friendship of both  with as many other agreeable associations
as mr <end> elton s very promising attachment was likely to add <end>

harriet was to sit again the next day  and mr <end> elton  just as he ought 
entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again <end>

 by all means <end>  we shall be most happy to consider you as one
of the party <end> 

the same civilities and courtesies  the same success and satisfaction 
took place on the morrow  and accompanied the whole progress
of the picture  which was rapid and happy <end>  every body who saw it
was pleased  but mr <end> elton was in continual raptures  and defended
it through every criticism <end>

 miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she
wanted    observed mrs <end> weston to him  not in the least suspecting
that she was addressing a lover <end>   the expression of the eye is
most correct  but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes <end>
it is the fault of her face that she has them not <end> 

 do you think so   replied he <end>   i cannot agree with you <end>
it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature <end>
i never saw such a likeness in my life <end>  we must allow for the effect
of shade  you know <end> 

 you have made her too tall  emma   said mr <end> knightley <end>

emma knew that she had  but would not own it  and mr <end> elton warmly added 

 oh no  certainly not too tall  not in the least too tall <end>  consider 
she is sitting down  which naturally presents a different  which
in short gives exactly the idea  and the proportions must
be preserved  you know <end>  proportions  fore shortening <end>  oh no  it
gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith s <end> exactly so indeed  

 it is very pretty   said mr <end> woodhouse <end>   so prettily done  just
as your drawings always are  my dear <end>  i do not know any body who draws
so well as you do <end>  the only thing i do not thoroughly like is 
that she seems to be sitting out of doors  with only a little shawl
over her shoulders  and it makes one think she must catch cold <end> 

 but  my dear papa  it is supposed to be summer  a warm day in summer <end>
look at the tree <end> 

 but it is never safe to sit out of doors  my dear <end> 

 you  sir  may say any thing   cried mr <end> elton   but i must confess
that i regard it as a most happy thought  the placing of miss
smith out of doors  and the tree is touched with such inimitable
spirit  any other situation would have been much less in character <end>
the naivete of miss smith s manners  and altogether  oh  it is
most admirable  i cannot keep my eyes from it <end>  i never saw such
a likeness <end> 

the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed  and here were a
few difficulties <end>  it must be done directly  it must be done in london 
the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste
could be depended on  and isabella  the usual doer of all commissions 
must not be applied to  because it was december  and mr <end> woodhouse
could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs
of december <end>  but no sooner was the distress known to mr <end> elton 
than it was removed <end>  his gallantry was always on the alert <end>
 might he be trusted with the commission  what infinite pleasure
should he have in executing it  he could ride to london at any time <end>
it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being
employed on such an errand <end> 

 he was too good   she could not endure the thought   she would
not give him such a troublesome office for the world    brought
on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances   and
a very few minutes settled the business <end>

mr <end> elton was to take the drawing to london  chuse the frame 
and give the directions  and emma thought she could so pack it
as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him  while he
seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough <end>

 what a precious deposit   said he with a tender sigh  as he
received it <end>

 this man is almost too gallant to be in love   thought emma <end>
 i should say so  but that i suppose there may be a hundred different
ways of being in love <end>  he is an excellent young man  and will suit
harriet exactly  it will be an  exactly so   as he says himself 
but he does sigh and languish  and study for compliments rather more
than i could endure as a principal <end>  i come in for a pretty good
share as a second <end>  but it is his gratitude on harriet s account <end> 



chapter vii


the very day of mr <end> elton s going to london produced a fresh occasion
for emma s services towards her friend <end>  harriet had been at hartfield 
as usual  soon after breakfast  and  after a time  had gone home
to return again to dinner  she returned  and sooner than had been
talked of  and with an agitated  hurried look  announcing something
extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell <end>
half a minute brought it all out <end>  she had heard  as soon as she got
back to mrs <end> goddard s  that mr <end> martin had been there an hour before 
and finding she was not at home  nor particularly expected  had left
a little parcel for her from one of his sisters  and gone away 
and on opening this parcel  she had actually found  besides the two
songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy  a letter to herself 
and this letter was from him  from mr <end> martin  and contained a direct
proposal of marriage <end>   who could have thought it  she was so surprized
she did not know what to do <end>  yes  quite a proposal of marriage 
and a very good letter  at least she thought so <end>  and he wrote
as if he really loved her very much  but she did not know  and so 
she was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she
should do <end>    emma was half ashamed of her friend for seeming so
pleased and so doubtful <end>

 upon my word   she cried   the young man is determined not to lose
any thing for want of asking <end>  he will connect himself well if he can <end> 

 will you read the letter   cried harriet <end>   pray do <end>  i d rather
you would <end> 

emma was not sorry to be pressed <end>  she read  and was surprized <end>
the style of the letter was much above her expectation <end>
there were not merely no grammatical errors  but as a composition it
would not have disgraced a gentleman  the language  though plain 
was strong and unaffected  and the sentiments it conveyed very much
to the credit of the writer <end>  it was short  but expressed good sense 
warm attachment  liberality  propriety  even delicacy of feeling <end>
she paused over it  while harriet stood anxiously watching for
her opinion  with a  well  well   and was at last forced to add 
 is it a good letter  or is it too short  

 yes  indeed  a very good letter   replied emma rather slowly   so
good a letter  harriet  that every thing considered  i think one of
his sisters must have helped him <end>  i can hardly imagine the young
man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself
so well  if left quite to his own powers  and yet it is not the
style of a woman  no  certainly  it is too strong and concise 
not diffuse enough for a woman <end>  no doubt he is a sensible man 
and i suppose may have a natural talent for  thinks strongly and
clearly  and when he takes a pen in hand  his thoughts naturally find
proper words <end>  it is so with some men <end>  yes  i understand the sort
of mind <end>  vigorous  decided  with sentiments to a certain point 
not coarse <end>  a better written letter  harriet  returning it  
than i had expected <end> 

 well   said the still waiting harriet    well  and  and what
shall i do  

 what shall you do  in what respect  do you mean with regard
to this letter  

 yes <end> 

 but what are you in doubt of  you must answer it of course  and speedily <end> 

 yes <end> but what shall i say  dear miss woodhouse  do advise me <end> 

 oh no  no  the letter had much better be all your own <end>  you will
express yourself very properly  i am sure <end>  there is no danger of your
not being intelligible  which is the first thing <end>  your meaning must
be unequivocal  no doubts or demurs  and such expressions of gratitude
and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires 
will present themselves unbidden to  your  mind  i am persuaded <end>
you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow
for his disappointment <end> 

 you think i ought to refuse him then   said harriet  looking down <end>

 ought to refuse him  my dear harriet  what do you mean  are you
in any doubt as to that  i thought  but i beg your pardon  perhaps i
have been under a mistake <end>  i certainly have been misunderstanding
you  if you feel in doubt as to the  purport  of your answer <end>
i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it <end> 

harriet was silent <end>  with a little reserve of manner  emma continued 

 you mean to return a favourable answer  i collect <end> 

 no  i do not  that is  i do not mean  what shall i do  what would
you advise me to do  pray  dear miss woodhouse  tell me what i
ought to do <end> 

 i shall not give you any advice  harriet <end>  i will have nothing to
do with it <end>  this is a point which you must settle with your feelings <end> 

 i had no notion that he liked me so very much   said harriet 
contemplating the letter <end>  for a little while emma persevered
in her silence  but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery
of that letter might be too powerful  she thought it best to say 

 i lay it down as a general rule  harriet  that if a woman  doubts 
as to whether she should accept a man or not  she certainly ought
to refuse him <end>  if she can hesitate as to  yes   she ought to say
 no  directly <end>  it is not a state to be safely entered into
with doubtful feelings  with half a heart <end>  i thought it my duty
as a friend  and older than yourself  to say thus much to you <end>
but do not imagine that i want to influence you <end> 

 oh  no  i am sure you are a great deal too kind to  but if you
would just advise me what i had best do  no  no  i do not mean
that  as you say  one s mind ought to be quite made up  one should
not be hesitating  it is a very serious thing <end>  it will be safer
to say  no   perhaps <end>  do you think i had better say  no   

 not for the world   said emma  smiling graciously   would i advise
you either way <end>  you must be the best judge of your own happiness <end>
if you prefer mr <end> martin to every other person  if you think him
the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with  why should
you hesitate  you blush  harriet <end>  does any body else occur to you
at this moment under such a definition  harriet  harriet  do not
deceive yourself  do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion <end>
at this moment whom are you thinking of  

the symptoms were favourable <end>  instead of answering  harriet turned
away confused  and stood thoughtfully by the fire  and though
the letter was still in her hand  it was now mechanically twisted
about without regard <end>  emma waited the result with impatience 
but not without strong hopes <end>  at last  with some hesitation 
harriet said  

 miss woodhouse  as you will not give me your opinion  i must
do as well as i can by myself  and i have now quite determined 
and really almost made up my mind  to refuse mr <end> martin <end>  do you
think i am right  

 perfectly  perfectly right  my dearest harriet  you are doing just
what you ought <end>  while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings
to myself  but now that you are so completely decided i have no
hesitation in approving <end>  dear harriet  i give myself joy of this <end>
it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance  which must have
been the consequence of your marrying mr <end> martin <end>  while you were in
the smallest degree wavering  i said nothing about it  because i would
not influence  but it would have been the loss of a friend to me <end>
i could not have visited mrs <end> robert martin  of abbey mill farm <end>
now i am secure of you for ever <end> 

harriet had not surmised her own danger  but the idea of it struck
her forcibly <end>

 you could not have visited me   she cried  looking aghast <end>
 no  to be sure you could not  but i never thought of that before <end>
that would have been too dreadful   what an escape   dear miss woodhouse 
i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you
for any thing in the world <end> 

 indeed  harriet  it would have been a severe pang to lose you 
but it must have been <end>  you would have thrown yourself out of all
good society <end>  i must have given you up <end> 

 dear me   how should i ever have borne it  it would have killed
me never to come to hartfield any more  

 dear affectionate creature    you  banished to abbey mill farm    you 
confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life 
i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it <end>
he must have a pretty good opinion of himself <end> 

 i do not think he is conceited either  in general   said harriet 
her conscience opposing such censure   at least  he is very good natured 
and i shall always feel much obliged to him  and have a great regard
for  but that is quite a different thing from  and you know 
though he may like me  it does not follow that i should  and
certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen
people  and if one comes to compare them  person and manners 
there is no comparison at all   one  is so very handsome and agreeable <end>
however  i do really think mr <end> martin a very amiable young man 
and have a great opinion of him  and his being so much attached
to me  and his writing such a letter  but as to leaving you 
it is what i would not do upon any consideration <end> 

 thank you  thank you  my own sweet little friend <end>  we will not
be parted <end>  a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked 
or because he is attached to her  and can write a tolerable letter <end> 

 oh no   and it is but a short letter too <end> 

emma felt the bad taste of her friend  but let it pass with a
 very true  and it would be a small consolation to her  for the
clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day 
to know that her husband could write a good letter <end> 

 oh  yes  very <end>  nobody cares for a letter  the thing is  to be always
happy with pleasant companions <end>  i am quite determined to refuse him <end>
but how shall i do  what shall i say  

emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer 
and advised its being written directly  which was agreed to 
in the hope of her assistance  and though emma continued to protest
against any assistance being wanted  it was in fact given in the
formation of every sentence <end>  the looking over his letter again 
in replying to it  had such a softening tendency  that it was
particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions 
and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy 
and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say 
and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful 
that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment 
he would have been accepted after all <end>

this letter  however  was written  and sealed  and sent <end>
the business was finished  and harriet safe <end>  she was rather low
all the evening  but emma could allow for her amiable regrets 
and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection 
sometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr <end> elton <end>

 i shall never be invited to abbey mill again   was said in rather
a sorrowful tone <end>

 nor  if you were  could i ever bear to part with you  my harriet <end>
you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared
to abbey mill <end> 

 and i am sure i should never want to go there  for i am never happy
but at hartfield <end> 

some time afterwards it was   i think mrs <end> goddard would be very
much surprized if she knew what had happened <end>  i am sure miss nash
would  for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married 
and it is only a linen draper <end> 

 one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the
teacher of a school  harriet <end>  i dare say miss nash would envy you
such an opportunity as this of being married <end>  even this conquest
would appear valuable in her eyes <end>  as to any thing superior for you 
i suppose she is quite in the dark <end>  the attentions of a certain
person can hardly be among the tittle tattle of highbury yet <end>
hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks
and manners have explained themselves <end> 

harriet blushed and smiled  and said something about wondering
that people should like her so much <end>  the idea of mr <end> elton was
certainly cheering  but still  after a time  she was tender hearted
again towards the rejected mr <end> martin <end>

 now he has got my letter   said she softly <end>   i wonder what they
are all doing  whether his sisters know  if he is unhappy 
they will be unhappy too <end>  i hope he will not mind it so very much <end> 

 let us think of those among our absent friends who are more
cheerfully employed   cried emma <end>   at this moment  perhaps  mr <end> elton
is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters  telling how much
more beautiful is the original  and after being asked for it five
or six times  allowing them to hear your name  your own dear name <end> 

 my picture   but he has left my picture in bond street <end> 

 has he so   then i know nothing of mr <end> elton <end>  no  my dear
little modest harriet  depend upon it the picture will not be
in bond street till just before he mounts his horse to morrow <end>
it is his companion all this evening  his solace  his delight <end>
it opens his designs to his family  it introduces you among them 
it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature 
eager curiosity and warm prepossession <end>  how cheerful  how animated 
how suspicious  how busy their imaginations all are  

harriet smiled again  and her smiles grew stronger <end>



chapter viii


harriet slept at hartfield that night <end>  for some weeks past she
had been spending more than half her time there  and gradually
getting to have a bed room appropriated to herself  and emma
judged it best in every respect  safest and kindest  to keep her
with them as much as possible just at present <end>  she was obliged
to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs <end> goddard s 
but it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield 
to make a regular visit of some days <end>

while she was gone  mr <end> knightley called  and sat some time with
mr <end> woodhouse and emma  till mr <end> woodhouse  who had previously made up
his mind to walk out  was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it 
and was induced by the entreaties of both  though against the scruples
of his own civility  to leave mr <end> knightley for that purpose <end>
mr <end> knightley  who had nothing of ceremony about him  was offering
by his short  decided answers  an amusing contrast to the protracted
apologies and civil hesitations of the other <end>

 well  i believe  if you will excuse me  mr <end> knightley  if you
will not consider me as doing a very rude thing  i shall take
emma s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour <end>  as the sun
is out  i believe i had better take my three turns while i can <end>
i treat you without ceremony  mr <end> knightley <end>  we invalids think we
are privileged people <end> 

 my dear sir  do not make a stranger of me <end> 

 i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter <end>  emma will be happy
to entertain you <end>  and therefore i think i will beg your excuse
and take my three turns  my winter walk <end> 

 you cannot do better  sir <end> 

 i would ask for the pleasure of your company  mr <end> knightley 
but i am a very slow walker  and my pace would be tedious to you 
and  besides  you have another long walk before you  to donwell abbey <end> 

 thank you  sir  thank you  i am going this moment myself  and i
think the sooner  you  go the better <end>  i will fetch your greatcoat
and open the garden door for you <end> 

mr <end> woodhouse at last was off  but mr <end> knightley  instead of being
immediately off likewise  sat down again  seemingly inclined
for more chat <end>  he began speaking of harriet  and speaking
of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before <end>

 i cannot rate her beauty as you do   said he   but she is a
pretty little creature  and i am inclined to think very well of
her disposition <end>  her character depends upon those she is with 
but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman <end> 

 i am glad you think so  and the good hands  i hope  may not be wanting <end> 

 come   said he   you are anxious for a compliment  so i will
tell you that you have improved her <end>  you have cured her of her
school girl s giggle  she really does you credit <end> 

 thank you <end>  i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i
had been of some use  but it is not every body who will bestow
praise where they may <end>   you  do not often overpower me with it <end> 

 you are expecting her again  you say  this morning  

 almost every moment <end>  she has been gone longer already than
she intended <end> 

 something has happened to delay her  some visitors perhaps <end> 

 highbury gossips   tiresome wretches  

 harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would <end> 

emma knew this was too true for contradiction  and therefore
said nothing <end>  he presently added  with a smile 

 i do not pretend to fix on times or places  but i must tell you
that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon
hear of something to her advantage <end> 

 indeed  how so  of what sort  

 a very serious sort  i assure you   still smiling <end>

 very serious  i can think of but one thing  who is in love
with her  who makes you their confidant  

emma was more than half in hopes of mr <end> elton s having dropt a hint <end>
mr <end> knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser  and she knew
mr <end> elton looked up to him <end>

 i have reason to think   he replied   that harriet smith will
soon have an offer of marriage  and from a most unexceptionable
quarter   robert martin is the man <end>  her visit to abbey mill 
this summer  seems to have done his business <end>  he is desperately
in love and means to marry her <end> 

 he is very obliging   said emma   but is he sure that harriet
means to marry him  

 well  well  means to make her an offer then <end>  will that do  he came
to the abbey two evenings ago  on purpose to consult me about it <end>
he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family  and 
i believe  considers me as one of his best friends <end>  he came to ask
me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early 
whether i thought her too young  in short  whether i approved his
choice altogether  having some apprehension perhaps of her being
considered  especially since  your  making so much of her  as in a line
of society above him <end>  i was very much pleased with all that he said <end>
i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin <end>
he always speaks to the purpose  open  straightforward  and very
well judging <end>  he told me every thing  his circumstances and plans 
and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage <end>  he is
an excellent young man  both as son and brother <end>  i had no hesitation
in advising him to marry <end>  he proved to me that he could afford it 
and that being the case  i was convinced he could not do better <end>
i praised the fair lady too  and altogether sent him away very happy <end>
if he had never esteemed my opinion before  he would have thought
highly of me then  and  i dare say  left the house thinking me the
best friend and counsellor man ever had <end>  this happened the night
before last <end>  now  as we may fairly suppose  he would not allow
much time to pass before he spoke to the lady  and as he does not
appear to have spoken yesterday  it is not unlikely that he should
be at mrs <end> goddard s to day  and she may be detained by a visitor 
without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch <end> 

 pray  mr <end> knightley   said emma  who had been smiling to herself
through a great part of this speech   how do you know that mr <end> martin
did not speak yesterday  

 certainly   replied he  surprized   i do not absolutely know it 
but it may be inferred <end>  was not she the whole day with you  

 come   said she   i will tell you something  in return for what
you have told me <end>  he did speak yesterday  that is  he wrote 
and was refused <end> 

this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed 
and mr <end> knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure 
as he stood up  in tall indignation  and said 

 then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her <end>
what is the foolish girl about  

 oh  to be sure   cried emma   it is always incomprehensible
to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage <end>
a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her <end> 

 nonsense  a man does not imagine any such thing <end>  but what is
the meaning of this  harriet smith refuse robert martin  madness 
if it is so  but i hope you are mistaken <end> 

 i saw her answer   nothing could be clearer <end> 

 you saw her answer   you wrote her answer too <end>  emma  this is
your doing <end>  you persuaded her to refuse him <end> 

 and if i did   which  however  i am far from allowing  i should
not feel that i had done wrong <end>  mr <end> martin is a very respectable
young man  but i cannot admit him to be harriet s equal  and am
rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her <end>
by your account  he does seem to have had some scruples <end>  it is
a pity that they were ever got over <end> 

 not harriet s equal   exclaimed mr <end> knightley loudly and warmly 
and with calmer asperity  added  a few moments afterwards   no  he
is not her equal indeed  for he is as much her superior in sense
as in situation <end>  emma  your infatuation about that girl blinds you <end>
what are harriet smith s claims  either of birth  nature or education 
to any connexion higher than robert martin  she is the natural
daughter of nobody knows whom  with probably no settled provision
at all  and certainly no respectable relations <end>  she is known only
as parlour boarder at a common school <end>  she is not a sensible girl 
nor a girl of any information <end>  she has been taught nothing useful 
and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself <end>
at her age she can have no experience  and with her little wit 
is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her <end>
she is pretty  and she is good tempered  and that is all <end>
my only scruple in advising the match was on his account  as being
beneath his deserts  and a bad connexion for him <end>  i felt that 
as to fortune  in all probability he might do much better  and that as
to a rational companion or useful helpmate  he could not do worse <end>
but i could not reason so to a man in love  and was willing
to trust to there being no harm in her  to her having that sort
of disposition  which  in good hands  like his  might be easily led
aright and turn out very well <end>  the advantage of the match i felt
to be all on her side  and had not the smallest doubt  nor have i now 
that there would be a general cry out upon her extreme good luck <end>
even  your  satisfaction i made sure of <end>  it crossed my mind immediately
that you would not regret your friend s leaving highbury  for the
sake of her being settled so well <end>  i remember saying to myself 
 even emma  with all her partiality for harriet  will think this a
good match <end>  

 i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say
any such thing <end>  what  think a farmer   and with all his sense and all
his merit mr <end> martin is nothing more   a good match for my intimate
friend  not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying
a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own  i
wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings <end>
i assure you mine are very different <end>  i must think your statement
by no means fair <end>  you are not just to harriet s claims <end>
they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself 
mr <end> martin may be the richest of the two  but he is undoubtedly
her inferior as to rank in society <end>  the sphere in which she moves
is much above his <end>  it would be a degradation <end> 

 a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance  to be married
to a respectable  intelligent gentleman farmer  

 as to the circumstances of her birth  though in a legal sense
she may be called nobody  it will not hold in common sense <end>
she is not to pay for the offence of others  by being held below
the level of those with whom she is brought up <end>  there can scarcely
be a doubt that her father is a gentleman  and a gentleman of
fortune <end>  her allowance is very liberal  nothing has ever been grudged
for her improvement or comfort <end>  that she is a gentleman s daughter 
is indubitable to me  that she associates with gentlemen s daughters 
no one  i apprehend  will deny <end>  she is superior to mr <end> robert martin <end> 

 whoever might be her parents   said mr <end> knightley   whoever may
have had the charge of her  it does not appear to have been any part
of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society <end>
after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in
mrs <end> goddard s hands to shift as she can   to move  in short 
in mrs <end> goddard s line  to have mrs <end> goddard s acquaintance <end>
her friends evidently thought this good enough for her  and it  was 
good enough <end>  she desired nothing better herself <end>  till you chose
to turn her into a friend  her mind had no distaste for her own set 
nor any ambition beyond it <end>  she was as happy as possible with the
martins in the summer <end>  she had no sense of superiority then <end>
if she has it now  you have given it <end>  you have been no friend to
harriet smith  emma <end>  robert martin would never have proceeded so far 
if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him <end>
i know him well <end>  he has too much real feeling to address any
woman on the haphazard of selfish passion <end>  and as to conceit 
he is the farthest from it of any man i know <end>  depend upon it he
had encouragement <end> 

it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this
assertion  she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again <end>

 you are a very warm friend to mr <end> martin  but  as i said before 
are unjust to harriet <end>  harriet s claims to marry well are not
so contemptible as you represent them <end>  she is not a clever girl 
but she has better sense than you are aware of  and does not
deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly <end>
waiving that point  however  and supposing her to be  as you
describe her  only pretty and good natured  let me tell you  that in
the degree she possesses them  they are not trivial recommendations
to the world in general  for she is  in fact  a beautiful girl 
and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred 
and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject
of beauty than they are generally supposed  till they do fall
in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces  a girl 
with such loveliness as harriet  has a certainty of being admired
and sought after  of having the power of chusing from among many 
consequently a claim to be nice <end>  her good nature  too  is not so very
slight a claim  comprehending  as it does  real  thorough sweetness
of temper and manner  a very humble opinion of herself  and a great
readiness to be pleased with other people <end>  i am very much mistaken
if your sex in general would not think such beauty  and such temper 
the highest claims a woman could possess <end> 

 upon my word  emma  to hear you abusing the reason you have 
is almost enough to make me think so too <end>  better be without sense 
than misapply it as you do <end> 

 to be sure   cried she playfully <end>   i know  that  is the feeling
of you all <end>  i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly
what every man delights in  what at once bewitches his senses
and satisfies his judgment <end>  oh  harriet may pick and chuse <end>
were you  yourself  ever to marry  she is the very woman for you <end>
and is she  at seventeen  just entering into life  just beginning
to be known  to be wondered at because she does not accept the first
offer she receives  no  pray let her have time to look about her <end> 

 i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy   said mr <end> knightley
presently   though i have kept my thoughts to myself  but i now
perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet <end>
you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty  and of what
she has a claim to  that  in a little while  nobody within her
reach will be good enough for her <end>  vanity working on a weak head 
produces every sort of mischief <end>  nothing so easy as for a young lady
to raise her expectations too high <end>  miss harriet smith may not find
offers of marriage flow in so fast  though she is a very pretty girl <end>
men of sense  whatever you may chuse to say  do not want silly wives <end>
men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves
with a girl of such obscurity  and most prudent men would be
afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in 
when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed <end>  let her marry
robert martin  and she is safe  respectable  and happy for ever 
but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly  and teach
her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence
and large fortune  she may be a parlour boarder at mrs <end> goddard s
all the rest of her life  or  at least   for harriet smith is a
girl who will marry somebody or other   till she grow desperate 
and is glad to catch at the old writing master s son <end> 

 we think so very differently on this point  mr <end> knightley 
that there can be no use in canvassing it <end>  we shall only be making
each other more angry <end>  but as to my  letting  her marry robert martin 
it is impossible  she has refused him  and so decidedly  i think 
as must prevent any second application <end>  she must abide by the evil
of having refused him  whatever it may be  and as to the refusal itself 
i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little 
but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do <end>
his appearance is so much against him  and his manner so bad 
that if she ever were disposed to favour him  she is not now <end>
i can imagine  that before she had seen any body superior 
she might tolerate him <end>  he was the brother of her friends 
and he took pains to please her  and altogether  having seen
nobody better  that must have been his great assistant 
she might not  while she was at abbey mill  find him disagreeable <end>
but the case is altered now <end>  she knows now what gentlemen are 
and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance
with harriet <end> 

 nonsense  errant nonsense  as ever was talked   cried mr <end> knightley <end>   robert
martin s manners have sense  sincerity  and good humour to recommend
them  and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand <end> 

emma made no answer  and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned  but was
really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone <end>
she did not repent what she had done  she still thought herself
a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he
could be  but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment
in general  which made her dislike having it so loudly against her 
and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state 
was very disagreeable <end>  some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence 
with only one attempt on emma s side to talk of the weather 
but he made no answer <end>  he was thinking <end>  the result of his thoughts
appeared at last in these words <end>

 robert martin has no great loss  if he can but think so  and i
hope it will not be long before he does <end>  your views for harriet
are best known to yourself  but as you make no secret of your love
of match making  it is fair to suppose that views  and plans 
and projects you have   and as a friend i shall just hint to you
that if elton is the man  i think it will be all labour in vain <end> 

emma laughed and disclaimed <end>  he continued 

 depend upon it  elton will not do <end>  elton is a very good sort of man 
and a very respectable vicar of highbury  but not at all likely
to make an imprudent match <end>  he knows the value of a good income
as well as any body <end>  elton may talk sentimentally  but he will
act rationally <end>  he is as well acquainted with his own claims  as you
can be with harriet s <end> he knows that he is a very handsome young man 
and a great favourite wherever he goes  and from his general way
of talking in unreserved moments  when there are only men present 
i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away <end>
i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family
of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with  who have all
twenty thousand pounds apiece <end> 

 i am very much obliged to you   said emma  laughing again <end>
 if i had set my heart on mr <end> elton s marrying harriet  it would
have been very kind to open my eyes  but at present i only want
to keep harriet to myself <end>  i have done with match making indeed <end>
i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls <end>  i shall leave
off while i am well <end> 

 good morning to you    said he  rising and walking off abruptly <end>
he was very much vexed <end>  he felt the disappointment of the young man 
and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it  by the
sanction he had given  and the part which he was persuaded emma had
taken in the affair  was provoking him exceedingly <end>

emma remained in a state of vexation too  but there was more
indistinctness in the causes of her s  than in his <end>  she did not always
feel so absolutely satisfied with herself  so entirely convinced that
her opinions were right and her adversary s wrong  as mr <end> knightley <end>
he walked off in more complete self approbation than he left for her <end>
she was not so materially cast down  however  but that a little
time and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives <end>
harriet s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy <end>
the possibility of the young man s coming to mrs <end> goddard s
that morning  and meeting with harriet and pleading his own cause 
gave alarming ideas <end>  the dread of such a failure after all became the
prominent uneasiness  and when harriet appeared  and in very good spirits 
and without having any such reason to give for her long absence 
she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind 
and convinced her  that let mr <end> knightley think or say what he would 
she had done nothing which woman s friendship and woman s feelings
would not justify <end>

he had frightened her a little about mr <end> elton  but when she considered
that mr <end> knightley could not have observed him as she had done 
neither with the interest  nor  she must be allowed to tell herself 
in spite of mr <end> knightley s pretensions  with the skill of such
an observer on such a question as herself  that he had spoken it
hastily and in anger  she was able to believe  that he had rather
said what he wished resentfully to be true  than what he knew
any thing about <end>  he certainly might have heard mr <end> elton speak
with more unreserve than she had ever done  and mr <end> elton might not
be of an imprudent  inconsiderate disposition as to money matters 
he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them 
but then  mr <end> knightley did not make due allowance for the influence
of a strong passion at war with all interested motives <end>  mr <end> knightley
saw no such passion  and of course thought nothing of its effects 
but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any
hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest 
and more than a reasonable  becoming degree of prudence  she was very
sure did not belong to mr <end> elton <end>

harriet s cheerful look and manner established hers  she came back 
not to think of mr <end> martin  but to talk of mr <end> elton <end>  miss nash
had been telling her something  which she repeated immediately
with great delight <end>  mr <end> perry had been to mrs <end> goddard s to attend
a sick child  and miss nash had seen him  and he had told miss nash 
that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park  he had met
mr <end> elton  and found to his great surprize  that mr <end> elton was
actually on his road to london  and not meaning to return till
the morrow  though it was the whist club night  which he had been
never known to miss before  and mr <end> perry had remonstrated with him
about it  and told him how shabby it was in him  their best player 
to absent himself  and tried very much to persuade him to put off
his journey only one day  but it would not do  mr <end> elton had been
determined to go on  and had said in a  very   particular  way indeed 
that he was going on business which he would not put off for any
inducement in the world  and something about a very enviable commission 
and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious <end>  mr <end> perry
could not quite understand him  but he was very sure there must
be a  lady  in the case  and he told him so  and mr <end> elton only
looked very conscious and smiling  and rode off in great spirits <end>
miss nash had told her all this  and had talked a great deal more
about mr <end> elton  and said  looking so very significantly at her 
 that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be 
but she only knew that any woman whom mr <end> elton could prefer 
she should think the luckiest woman in the world  for  beyond a doubt 
mr <end> elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness <end> 



chapter ix


mr <end> knightley might quarrel with her  but emma could not quarrel
with herself <end>  he was so much displeased  that it was longer than
usual before he came to hartfield again  and when they did meet 
his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven <end>  she was sorry 
but could not repent <end>  on the contrary  her plans and proceedings
were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general
appearances of the next few days <end>

the picture  elegantly framed  came safely to hand soon after
mr <end> elton s return  and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common
sitting room  he got up to look at it  and sighed out his half sentences
of admiration just as he ought  and as for harriet s feelings  they were
visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment
as her youth and sort of mind admitted <end>  emma was soon perfectly
satisfied of mr <end> martin s being no otherwise remembered  than as
he furnished a contrast with mr <end> elton  of the utmost advantage to the latter <end>

her views of improving her little friend s mind  by a great deal
of useful reading and conversation  had never yet led to more than
a few first chapters  and the intention of going on to morrow <end>
it was much easier to chat than to study  much pleasanter to let
her imagination range and work at harriet s fortune  than to be
labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts 
and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present 
the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life 
was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort
that she could meet with  into a thin quarto of hot pressed paper 
made up by her friend  and ornamented with ciphers and trophies <end>

in this age of literature  such collections on a very grand scale
are not uncommon <end>  miss nash  head teacher at mrs <end> goddard s 
had written out at least three hundred  and harriet  who had taken
the first hint of it from her  hoped  with miss woodhouse s help 
to get a great many more <end>  emma assisted with her invention 
memory and taste  and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand 
it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order  in form
as well as quantity <end>

mr <end> woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls 
and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in <end>
 so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young  he
wondered he could not remember them  but he hoped he should in time <end> 
and it always ended in  kitty  a fair but frozen maid <end> 

his good friend perry  too  whom he had spoken to on the subject 
did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind 
but he had desired perry to be upon the watch  and as he went about
so much  something  he thought  might come from that quarter <end>

it was by no means his daughter s wish that the intellects of
highbury in general should be put under requisition <end>  mr <end> elton
was the only one whose assistance she asked <end>  he was invited
to contribute any really good enigmas  charades  or conundrums
that he might recollect  and she had the pleasure of seeing him
most intently at work with his recollections  and at the same time 
as she could perceive  most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant 
nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass
his lips <end>  they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles 
and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled 
and rather sentimentally recited  that well known charade 

    my first doth affliction denote 
      which my second is destin d to feel
    and my whole is the best antidote
      that affliction to soften and heal <end>  

made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it
some pages ago already <end>

 why will not you write one yourself for us  mr <end> elton   said she 
 that is the only security for its freshness  and nothing could be
easier to you <end> 

 oh no  he had never written  hardly ever  any thing of the kind
in his life <end>  the stupidest fellow  he was afraid not even miss
woodhouse   he stopt a moment   or miss smith could inspire him <end> 

the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration <end>
he called for a few moments  just to leave a piece of paper on the
table containing  as he said  a charade  which a friend of his had
addressed to a young lady  the object of his admiration  but which 
from his manner  emma was immediately convinced must be his own <end>

 i do not offer it for miss smith s collection   said he <end>
 being my friend s  i have no right to expose it in any degree
to the public eye  but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it <end> 

the speech was more to emma than to harriet  which emma
could understand <end>  there was deep consciousness about him 
and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend s <end>
he was gone the next moment   after another moment s pause 

 take it   said emma  smiling  and pushing the paper towards
harriet   it is for you <end>  take your own <end> 

but harriet was in a tremor  and could not touch it  and emma 
never loth to be first  was obliged to examine it herself <end>

        to miss  

          charade <end>

    my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings 
      lords of the earth  their luxury and ease <end>
    another view of man  my second brings 
      behold him there  the monarch of the seas 

    but ah  united  what reverse we have 
      man s boasted power and freedom  all are flown 
    lord of the earth and sea  he bends a slave 
      and woman  lovely woman  reigns alone <end>

      thy ready wit the word will soon supply 
      may its approval beam in that soft eye 

she cast her eye over it  pondered  caught the meaning  read it through
again to be quite certain  and quite mistress of the lines  and then
passing it to harriet  sat happily smiling  and saying to herself 
while harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion
of hope and dulness   very well  mr <end> elton  very well indeed <end>
i have read worse charades <end>   courtship   a very good hint <end>  i give
you credit for it <end>  this is feeling your way <end>  this is saying very
plainly   pray  miss smith  give me leave to pay my addresses to you <end>
approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance <end> 

      may its approval beam in that soft eye 

harriet exactly <end>  soft is the very word for her eye  of all epithets 
the justest that could be given <end>

      thy ready wit the word will soon supply <end>

humph  harriet s ready wit  all the better <end>  a man must be very much
in love  indeed  to describe her so <end>  ah  mr <end> knightley  i wish
you had the benefit of this  i think this would convince you <end>
for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken <end>
an excellent charade indeed  and very much to the purpose <end>
things must come to a crisis soon now <end>

she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations 
which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length  by the
eagerness of harriet s wondering questions <end>

 what can it be  miss woodhouse   what can it be  i have not an idea  i
cannot guess it in the least <end>  what can it possibly be  do try
to find it out  miss woodhouse <end>  do help me <end>  i never saw any thing
so hard <end>  is it kingdom  i wonder who the friend was  and who could
be the young lady <end>  do you think it is a good one  can it be woman 

      and woman  lovely woman  reigns alone <end>

can it be neptune 

      behold him there  the monarch of the seas 

or a trident  or a mermaid  or a shark  oh  no  shark is only
one syllable <end>  it must be very clever  or he would not have brought it <end>
oh  miss woodhouse  do you think we shall ever find it out  

 mermaids and sharks  nonsense  my dear harriet  what are you
thinking of  where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made
by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark  give me the paper and listen <end>

for miss             read miss smith <end>

    my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings 
      lords of the earth  their luxury and ease <end>

that is  court  <end>

    another view of man  my second brings 
      behold him there  the monarch of the seas 

that is  ship    plain as it can be <end>  now for the cream <end>

    but ah  united    courtship   you know   what reverse we have 
      man s boasted power and freedom  all are flown <end>
    lord of the earth and sea  he bends a slave 
      and woman  lovely woman  reigns alone <end>

a very proper compliment   and then follows the application 
which i think  my dear harriet  you cannot find much difficulty
in comprehending <end>  read it in comfort to yourself <end>  there can
be no doubt of its being written for you and to you <end> 

harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion <end>
she read the concluding lines  and was all flutter and happiness <end>
she could not speak <end>  but she was not wanted to speak <end>  it was enough
for her to feel <end>  emma spoke for her <end>

 there is so pointed  and so particular a meaning in this compliment  
said she   that i cannot have a doubt as to mr <end> elton s intentions <end>
you are his object  and you will soon receive the completest proof
of it <end>  i thought it must be so <end>  i thought i could not be so deceived 
but now  it is clear  the state of his mind is as clear and decided 
as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you <end>
yes  harriet  just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance
to happen what has happened <end>  i could never tell whether an attachment
between you and mr <end> elton were most desirable or most natural <end>
its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each
other  i am very happy <end>  i congratulate you  my dear harriet  with all
my heart <end>  this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride
in creating <end>  this is a connexion which offers nothing but good <end>
it will give you every thing that you want  consideration  independence 
a proper home  it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends 
close to hartfield and to me  and confirm our intimacy for ever <end>
this  harriet  is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either
of us <end> 

 dear miss woodhouse    and  dear miss woodhouse   was all that harriet 
with many tender embraces could articulate at first  but when they
did arrive at something more like conversation  it was sufficiently
clear to her friend that she saw  felt  anticipated  and remembered
just as she ought <end>  mr <end> elton s superiority had very ample acknowledgment <end>

 whatever you say is always right   cried harriet   and therefore
i suppose  and believe  and hope it must be so  but otherwise i could
not have imagined it <end>  it is so much beyond any thing i deserve <end>
mr <end> elton  who might marry any body  there cannot be two opinions
about  him  <end>  he is so very superior <end>  only think of those sweet
verses   to miss          <end>  dear me  how clever   could it really
be meant for me  

 i cannot make a question  or listen to a question about that <end>
it is a certainty <end>  receive it on my judgment <end>  it is a sort
of prologue to the play  a motto to the chapter  and will be soon
followed by matter of fact prose <end> 

 it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected <end>  i am sure 
a month ago  i had no more idea myself   the strangest things do
take place  

 when miss smiths and mr <end> eltons get acquainted  they do indeed  and
really it is strange  it is out of the common course that what is
so evidently  so palpably desirable  what courts the pre arrangement
of other people  should so immediately shape itself into the proper form <end>
you and mr <end> elton are by situation called together  you belong
to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes <end>
your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls <end>  there does
seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love
exactly the right direction  and sends it into the very channel
where it ought to flow <end>

      the course of true love never did run smooth  

a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage <end> 

 that mr <end> elton should really be in love with me   me  of all people 
who did not know him  to speak to him  at michaelmas  and he 
the very handsomest man that ever was  and a man that every body
looks up to  quite like mr <end> knightley  his company so sought after 
that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he
does not chuse it  that he has more invitations than there are days
in the week <end>  and so excellent in the church  miss nash has put down
all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury <end>
dear me  when i look back to the first time i saw him  how little
did i think   the two abbots and i ran into the front room and
peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by  and miss
nash came and scolded us away  and staid to look through herself 
however  she called me back presently  and let me look too 
which was very good natured <end> and how beautiful we thought he looked 
he was arm in arm with mr <end> cole <end> 

 this is an alliance which  whoever  whatever your friends may be 
must be agreeable to them  provided at least they have common sense 
and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools <end>  if they
are anxious to see you  happily  married  here is a man whose amiable
character gives every assurance of it   if they wish to have you
settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen
to place you in  here it will be accomplished  and if their only
object is that you should  in the common phrase  be  well  married 
here is the comfortable fortune  the respectable establishment 
the rise in the world which must satisfy them <end> 

 yes  very true <end>  how nicely you talk  i love to hear you <end>
you understand every thing <end>  you and mr <end> elton are one as clever
as the other <end>  this charade   if i had studied a twelvemonth 
i could never have made any thing like it <end> 

 i thought he meant to try his skill  by his manner of declining
it yesterday <end> 

 i do think it is  without exception  the best charade i ever read <end> 

 i never read one more to the purpose  certainly <end> 

 it is as long again as almost all we have had before <end> 

 i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour <end>
such things in general cannot be too short <end> 

harriet was too intent on the lines to hear <end>  the most satisfactory
comparisons were rising in her mind <end>

 it is one thing   said she  presently  her cheeks in a glow   to
have very good sense in a common way  like every body else 
and if there is any thing to say  to sit down and write a letter 
and say just what you must  in a short way  and another  to write
verses and charades like this <end> 

emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr <end> martin s prose <end>

 such sweet lines   continued harriet   these two last   but
how shall i ever be able to return the paper  or say i have found
it out   oh  miss woodhouse  what can we do about that  

 leave it to me <end>  you do nothing <end>  he will be here this evening 
i dare say  and then i will give it him back  and some nonsense
or other will pass between us  and you shall not be committed <end>  your
soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming <end>  trust to me <end> 

 oh  miss woodhouse  what a pity that i must not write this beautiful
charade into my book  i am sure i have not got one half so good <end> 

 leave out the two last lines  and there is no reason why you
should not write it into your book <end> 

 oh  but those two lines are   

   the best of all <end>  granted   for private enjoyment  and for private
enjoyment keep them <end>  they are not at all the less written you know 
because you divide them <end>  the couplet does not cease to be  nor does
its meaning change <end>  but take it away  and all  appropriation  ceases 
and a very pretty gallant charade remains  fit for any collection <end>
depend upon it  he would not like to have his charade slighted 
much better than his passion <end>  a poet in love must be encouraged in
both capacities  or neither <end>  give me the book  i will write it down 
and then there can be no possible reflection on you <end> 

harriet submitted  though her mind could hardly separate the parts 
so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down
a declaration of love <end>  it seemed too precious an offering for any
degree of publicity <end>

 i shall never let that book go out of my own hands   said she <end>

 very well   replied emma   a most natural feeling  and the longer
it lasts  the better i shall be pleased <end>  but here is my father
coming  you will not object to my reading the charade to him <end>
it will be giving him so much pleasure  he loves any thing of
the sort  and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment <end>
he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all   you must
let me read it to him <end> 

harriet looked grave <end>

 my dear harriet  you must not refine too much upon this
charade <end>  you will betray your feelings improperly  if you are
too conscious and too quick  and appear to affix more meaning 
or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it <end>
do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration <end>
if he had been anxious for secrecy  he would not have left the paper
while i was by  but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you <end>
do not let us be too solemn on the business <end>  he has encouragement
enough to proceed  without our sighing out our souls over this charade <end> 

 oh  no  i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it <end>  do as you please <end> 

mr <end> woodhouse came in  and very soon led to the subject again 
by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of  well  my dears 
how does your book go on   have you got any thing fresh  

 yes  papa  we have something to read you  something quite fresh <end>
a piece of paper was found on the table this morning   dropt 
we suppose  by a fairy   containing a very pretty charade  and we
have just copied it in <end> 

she read it to him  just as he liked to have any thing read 
slowly and distinctly  and two or three times over  with explanations
of every part as she proceeded  and he was very much pleased  and 
as she had foreseen  especially struck with the complimentary conclusion <end>

 aye  that s very just  indeed  that s very properly said <end>
very true <end>   woman  lovely woman <end>  it is such a pretty charade 
my dear  that i can easily guess what fairy brought it <end>  nobody
could have written so prettily  but you  emma <end> 

emma only nodded  and smiled <end>  after a little thinking 
and a very tender sigh  he added 

 ah  it is no difficulty to see who you take after  your dear mother
was so clever at all those things  if i had but her memory  but i
can remember nothing   not even that particular riddle which you
have heard me mention  i can only recollect the first stanza 
and there are several <end>

    kitty  a fair but frozen maid 
      kindled a flame i yet deplore 
    the hood wink d boy i called to aid 
    though of his near approach afraid 
      so fatal to my suit before <end>

and that is all that i can recollect of it  but it is very clever
all the way through <end>  but i think  my dear  you said you had got it <end> 

 yes  papa  it is written out in our second page <end>  we copied it
from the elegant extracts <end>  it was garrick s  you know <end> 

 aye  very true <end>  i wish i could recollect more of it <end>

    kitty  a fair but frozen maid <end>

the name makes me think of poor isabella  for she was very near
being christened catherine after her grandmama <end>  i hope we shall
have her here next week <end>  have you thought  my dear  where you
shall put her  and what room there will be for the children  

 oh  yes  she will have her own room  of course  the room she always
has   and there is the nursery for the children   just as usual 
you know <end>  why should there be any change  

 i do not know  my dear  but it is so long since she was here   not
since last easter  and then only for a few days <end>  mr <end> john knightley s
being a lawyer is very inconvenient <end>  poor isabella   she is sadly
taken away from us all   and how sorry she will be when she comes 
not to see miss taylor here  

 she will not be surprized  papa  at least <end> 

 i do not know  my dear <end>  i am sure i was very much surprized
when i first heard she was going to be married <end> 

 we must ask mr <end> and mrs <end> weston to dine with us  while isabella
is here <end> 

 yes  my dear  if there is time <end>  but   in a very depressed tone   she
is coming for only one week <end>  there will not be time for any thing <end> 

 it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer  but it seems a case
of necessity <end>  mr <end> john knightley must be in town again on the 28th 
and we ought to be thankful  papa  that we are to have the whole
of the time they can give to the country  that two or three days
are not to be taken out for the abbey <end>  mr <end> knightley promises
to give up his claim this christmas  though you know it is longer
since they were with him  than with us <end> 

 it would be very hard  indeed  my dear  if poor isabella were
to be anywhere but at hartfield <end> 

mr <end> woodhouse could never allow for mr <end> knightley s claims on
his brother  or any body s claims on isabella  except his own <end>
he sat musing a little while  and then said 

 but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back
so soon  though he does <end>  i think  emma  i shall try and persuade
her to stay longer with us <end>  she and the children might stay very well <end> 

 ah  papa  that is what you never have been able to accomplish 
and i do not think you ever will <end>  isabella cannot bear to stay
behind her husband <end> 

this was too true for contradiction <end>  unwelcome as it was  mr <end> woodhouse
could only give a submissive sigh  and as emma saw his spirits
affected by the idea of his daughter s attachment to her husband 
she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them <end>

 harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while
my brother and sister are here <end>  i am sure she will be pleased
with the children <end>  we are very proud of the children  are not we 
papa  i wonder which she will think the handsomest  henry or john  

 aye  i wonder which she will <end>  poor little dears  how glad they
will be to come <end>  they are very fond of being at hartfield  harriet <end> 

 i dare say they are  sir <end>  i am sure i do not know who is not <end> 

 henry is a fine boy  but john is very like his mama <end>  henry is the eldest 
he was named after me  not after his father <end>  john  the second 
is named after his father <end>  some people are surprized  i believe 
that the eldest was not  but isabella would have him called henry 
which i thought very pretty of her <end>  and he is a very clever boy 
indeed <end>  they are all remarkably clever  and they have so many
pretty ways <end>  they will come and stand by my chair  and say 
 grandpapa  can you give me a bit of string   and once henry asked me
for a knife  but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas <end>
i think their father is too rough with them very often <end> 

 he appears rough to you   said emma   because you are so very
gentle yourself  but if you could compare him with other papas 
you would not think him rough <end>  he wishes his boys to be active and hardy 
and if they misbehave  can give them a sharp word now and then 
but he is an affectionate father  certainly mr <end> john knightley
is an affectionate father <end>  the children are all fond of him <end> 

 and then their uncle comes in  and tosses them up to the ceiling
in a very frightful way  

 but they like it  papa  there is nothing they like so much <end>
it is such enjoyment to them  that if their uncle did not lay down
the rule of their taking turns  whichever began would never give way
to the other <end> 

 well  i cannot understand it <end> 

 that is the case with us all  papa <end>  one half of the world cannot
understand the pleasures of the other <end> 

later in the morning  and just as the girls were going to separate
in preparation for the regular four o clock dinner  the hero
of this inimitable charade walked in again <end>  harriet turned away 
but emma could receive him with the usual smile  and her quick eye
soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push  of
having thrown a die  and she imagined he was come to see how it
might turn up <end>  his ostensible reason  however  was to ask whether
mr <end> woodhouse s party could be made up in the evening without him 
or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield <end>
if he were  every thing else must give way  but otherwise his friend
cole had been saying so much about his dining with him  had made
such a point of it  that he had promised him conditionally to come <end>

emma thanked him  but could not allow of his disappointing his
friend on their account  her father was sure of his rubber <end>
he re urged  she re declined  and he seemed then about to make
his bow  when taking the paper from the table  she returned it  

 oh  here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us 
thank you for the sight of it <end>  we admired it so much  that i have
ventured to write it into miss smith s collection <end>  your friend
will not take it amiss i hope <end>  of course i have not transcribed
beyond the first eight lines <end> 

mr <end> elton certainly did not very well know what to say <end>
he looked rather doubtingly  rather confused  said something about
 honour    glanced at emma and at harriet  and then seeing the book
open on the table  took it up  and examined it very attentively <end>
with the view of passing off an awkward moment  emma smilingly said 

 you must make my apologies to your friend  but so good a charade
must not be confined to one or two <end>  he may be sure of every woman s
approbation while he writes with such gallantry <end> 

 i have no hesitation in saying   replied mr <end> elton  though hesitating
a good deal while he spoke   i have no hesitation in saying  at
least if my friend feels at all as  i  do  i have not the smallest
doubt that  could he see his little effusion honoured as  i  see it 
 looking at the book again  and replacing it on the table   he
would consider it as the proudest moment of his life <end> 

after this speech he was gone as soon as possible <end>  emma could not
think it too soon  for with all his good and agreeable qualities 
there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt
to incline her to laugh <end>  she ran away to indulge the inclination 
leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriet s share <end>



chapter x


though now the middle of december  there had yet been no weather
to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise 
and on the morrow  emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor
sick family  who lived a little way out of highbury <end>

their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane  a lane
leading at right angles from the broad  though irregular  main street
of the place  and  as may be inferred  containing the blessed abode
of mr <end> elton <end>  a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed 
and then  about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage 
an old and not very good house  almost as close to the road as it
could be <end>  it had no advantage of situation  but had been very much
smartened up by the present proprietor  and  such as it was 
there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without
a slackened pace and observing eyes <end>  emma s remark was  

 there it is <end>  there go you and your riddle book one of these days <end>   
harriet s was  

 oh  what a sweet house   how very beautiful   there are the yellow
curtains that miss nash admires so much <end> 

 i do not often walk this way  now    said emma  as they proceeded 
 but  then  there will be an inducement  and i shall gradually get
intimately acquainted with all the hedges  gates  pools and pollards
of this part of highbury <end> 

harriet  she found  had never in her life been within side the vicarage 
and her curiosity to see it was so extreme  that  considering exteriors
and probabilities  emma could only class it  as a proof of love 
with mr <end> elton s seeing ready wit in her <end>

 i wish we could contrive it   said she   but i cannot think
of any tolerable pretence for going in   no servant that i want
to inquire about of his housekeeper  no message from my father <end> 

she pondered  but could think of nothing <end>  after a mutual silence
of some minutes  harriet thus began again  

 i do so wonder  miss woodhouse  that you should not be married 
or going to be married  so charming as you are    

emma laughed  and replied 

 my being charming  harriet  is not quite enough to induce me to marry 
i must find other people charming  one other person at least <end>
and i am not only  not going to be married  at present  but have
very little intention of ever marrying at all <end> 

 ah   so you say  but i cannot believe it <end> 

 i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet 
to be tempted  mr <end> elton  you know   recollecting herself  
is out of the question   and i do  not  wish to see any such person <end>
i would rather not be tempted <end>  i cannot really change for the better <end>
if i were to marry  i must expect to repent it <end> 

 dear me   it is so odd to hear a woman talk so    

 i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry <end>
were i to fall in love  indeed  it would be a different thing 
but i never have been in love  it is not my way  or my nature 
and i do not think i ever shall <end>  and  without love  i am sure i
should be a fool to change such a situation as mine <end>  fortune i
do not want  employment i do not want  consequence i do not want 
i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their
husband s house as i am of hartfield  and never  never could i expect
to be so truly beloved and important  so always first and always
right in any man s eyes as i am in my father s <end> 

 but then  to be an old maid at last  like miss bates  

 that is as formidable an image as you could present  harriet  and if i
thought i should ever be like miss bates  so silly  so satisfied  
so smiling  so prosing  so undistinguishing and unfastidious  
and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me 
i would marry to morrow <end> but between  us   i am convinced there never
can be any likeness  except in being unmarried <end> 

 but still  you will be an old maid  and that s so dreadful  

 never mind  harriet  i shall not be a poor old maid  and it is
poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public 
a single woman  with a very narrow income  must be a ridiculous 
disagreeable old maid  the proper sport of boys and girls 
but a single woman  of good fortune  is always respectable 
and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else <end>  and the
distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common
sense of the world as appears at first  for a very narrow income
has a tendency to contract the mind  and sour the temper <end>
those who can barely live  and who live perforce in a very small 
and generally very inferior  society  may well be illiberal and cross <end>
this does not apply  however  to miss bates  she is only too good
natured and too silly to suit me  but  in general  she is very
much to the taste of every body  though single and though poor <end>
poverty certainly has not contracted her mind   i really believe 
if she had only a shilling in the world  she would be very likely
to give away sixpence of it  and nobody is afraid of her   that is a
great charm <end> 

 dear me  but what shall you do  how shall you employ yourself
when you grow old  

 if i know myself  harriet  mine is an active  busy mind  with a great
many independent resources  and i do not perceive why i should be
more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one and twenty <end>
woman s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then
as they are now  or with no important variation <end>  if i draw less 
i shall read more  if i give up music  i shall take to carpet work <end>
and as for objects of interest  objects for the affections 
which is in truth the great point of inferiority  the want of which
is really the great evil to be avoided in  not  marrying  i shall
be very well off  with all the children of a sister i love so much 
to care about <end>  there will be enough of them  in all probability 
to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need <end>
there will be enough for every hope and every fear  and though my
attachment to none can equal that of a parent  it suits my ideas
of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder <end>  my nephews
and nieces   i shall often have a niece with me <end> 

 do you know miss bates s niece   that is  i know you must have
seen her a hundred times  but are you acquainted  

 oh  yes  we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes
to highbury <end>  by the bye   that  is almost enough to put one out
of conceit with a niece <end>  heaven forbid  at least  that i should
ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together 
as she does about jane fairfax <end>  one is sick of the very name
of jane fairfax <end>  every letter from her is read forty times over 
her compliments to all friends go round and round again  and if she
does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher  or knit a pair
of garters for her grandmother  one hears of nothing else for a month <end>
i wish jane fairfax very well  but she tires me to death <end> 

they were now approaching the cottage  and all idle topics
were superseded <end>  emma was very compassionate  and the distresses
of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention
and kindness  her counsel and her patience  as from her purse <end>
she understood their ways  could allow for their ignorance and
their temptations  had no romantic expectations of extraordinary
virtue from those for whom education had done so little  entered into
their troubles with ready sympathy  and always gave her assistance
with as much intelligence as good will <end>  in the present instance 
it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit 
and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice 
she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene
as made her say to harriet  as they walked away 

 these are the sights  harriet  to do one good <end>  how trifling they
make every thing else appear   i feel now as if i could think of
nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day  and yet 
who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind  

 very true   said harriet <end>   poor creatures  one can think
of nothing else <end> 

 and really  i do not think the impression will soon be over  
said emma  as she crossed the low hedge  and tottering footstep
which ended the narrow  slippery path through the cottage garden 
and brought them into the lane again <end>   i do not think it will  
stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place 
and recall the still greater within <end>

 oh  dear  no   said her companion <end>

they walked on <end>  the lane made a slight bend  and when that bend
was passed  mr <end> elton was immediately in sight  and so near
as to give emma time only to say farther 

 ah   harriet  here comes a very sudden trial of our stability
in good thoughts <end>  well   smiling   i hope it may be allowed that
if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers 
it has done all that is truly important <end>  if we feel for the wretched 
enough to do all we can for them  the rest is empty sympathy 
only distressing to ourselves <end> 

harriet could just answer   oh  dear  yes   before the gentleman
joined them <end>  the wants and sufferings of the poor family  however 
were the first subject on meeting <end>  he had been going to call
on them <end>  his visit he would now defer  but they had a very
interesting parley about what could be done and should be done <end>
mr <end> elton then turned back to accompany them <end>

 to fall in with each other on such an errand as this   thought emma 
 to meet in a charitable scheme  this will bring a great increase
of love on each side <end>  i should not wonder if it were to bring
on the declaration <end>  it must  if i were not here <end>  i wish i were
anywhere else <end> 

anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could  she soon
afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath  a little raised
on one side of the lane  leaving them together in the main road <end>
but she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriet s
habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too  and that 
in short  they would both be soon after her <end>  this would not do 
she immediately stopped  under pretence of having some alteration
to make in the lacing of her half boot  and stooping down in complete
occupation of the footpath  begged them to have the goodness to walk on 
and she would follow in half a minute <end>  they did as they were desired 
and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot 
she had the comfort of farther delay in her power  being overtaken
by a child from the cottage  setting out  according to orders 
with her pitcher  to fetch broth from hartfield <end>  to walk by the side
of this child  and talk to and question her  was the most natural
thing in the world  or would have been the most natural  had she been
acting just then without design  and by this means the others were
still able to keep ahead  without any obligation of waiting for her <end>
she gained on them  however  involuntarily   the child s pace was quick 
and theirs rather slow  and she was the more concerned at it 
from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them <end>
mr <end> elton was speaking with animation  harriet listening with a very
pleased attention  and emma  having sent the child on  was beginning
to think how she might draw back a little more  when they both
looked around  and she was obliged to join them <end>

mr <end> elton was still talking  still engaged in some interesting detail 
and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he
was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday s
party at his friend cole s  and that she was come in herself for
the stilton cheese  the north wiltshire  the butter  the cellery 
the beet root  and all the dessert <end>

 this would soon have led to something better  of course   was her
consoling reflection   any thing interests between those who love 
and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart <end>
if i could but have kept longer away  

they now walked on together quietly  till within view of the vicarage
pales  when a sudden resolution  of at least getting harriet into
the house  made her again find something very much amiss about her boot 
and fall behind to arrange it once more <end>  she then broke the lace
off short  and dexterously throwing it into a ditch  was presently
obliged to entreat them to stop  and acknowledged her inability to
put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort <end>

 part of my lace is gone   said she   and i do not know how i am
to contrive <end>  i really am a most troublesome companion to you both 
but i hope i am not often so ill equipped <end> mr <end> elton  i must beg
leave to stop at your house  and ask your housekeeper for a bit
of ribband or string  or any thing just to keep my boot on <end> 

mr <end> elton looked all happiness at this proposition  and nothing
could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into
his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage <end>
the room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied 
and looking forwards  behind it was another with which it immediately
communicated  the door between them was open  and emma passed
into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most
comfortable manner <end>  she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she
found it  but she fully intended that mr <end> elton should close it <end>
it was not closed  however  it still remained ajar  but by engaging
the housekeeper in incessant conversation  she hoped to make it
practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room <end>
for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself <end>  it could
be protracted no longer <end>  she was then obliged to be finished 
and make her appearance <end>

the lovers were standing together at one of the windows <end>  it had a
most favourable aspect  and  for half a minute  emma felt the glory
of having schemed successfully <end>  but it would not do  he had not
come to the point <end>  he had been most agreeable  most delightful 
he had told harriet that he had seen them go by  and had purposely
followed them  other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt 
but nothing serious <end>

 cautious  very cautious   thought emma   he advances inch by inch 
and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure <end> 

still  however  though every thing had not been accomplished
by her ingenious device  she could not but flatter herself
that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both 
and must be leading them forward to the great event <end>



chapter xi


mr <end> elton must now be left to himself <end>  it was no longer in emma s
power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures <end>
the coming of her sister s family was so very near at hand 
that first in anticipation  and then in reality  it became henceforth
her prime object of interest  and during the ten days of their stay
at hartfield it was not to be expected  she did not herself expect  
that any thing beyond occasional  fortuitous assistance could
be afforded by her to the lovers <end>  they might advance rapidly
if they would  however  they must advance somehow or other whether
they would or no <end>  she hardly wished to have more leisure for them <end>
there are people  who the more you do for them  the less they will
do for themselves <end>

mr <end> and mrs <end> john knightley  from having been longer than usual
absent from surry  were exciting of course rather more than the
usual interest <end>  till this year  every long vacation since their
marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey 
but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea bathing
for the children  and it was therefore many months since they had
been seen in a regular way by their surry connexions  or seen at all
by mr <end> woodhouse  who could not be induced to get so far as london 
even for poor isabella s sake  and who consequently was now most
nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit <end>

he thought much of the evils of the journey for her  and not a
little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to
bring some of the party the last half of the way  but his alarms
were needless  the sixteen miles being happily accomplished 
and mr <end> and mrs <end> john knightley  their five children  and a competent
number of nursery maids  all reaching hartfield in safety <end>
the bustle and joy of such an arrival  the many to be talked to 
welcomed  encouraged  and variously dispersed and disposed of 
produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne
under any other cause  nor have endured much longer even for this 
but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were
so respected by mrs <end> john knightley  that in spite of maternal
solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones 
and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance 
all the eating and drinking  and sleeping and playing 
which they could possibly wish for  without the smallest delay 
the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him 
either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them <end>

mrs <end> john knightley was a pretty  elegant little woman  of gentle 
quiet manners  and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate 
wrapt up in her family  a devoted wife  a doating mother 
and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that  but for
these higher ties  a warmer love might have seemed impossible <end>
she could never see a fault in any of them <end>  she was not a woman
of strong understanding or any quickness  and with this resemblance
of her father  she inherited also much of his constitution 
was delicate in her own health  over careful of that of her children 
had many fears and many nerves  and was as fond of her own mr <end> wingfield
in town as her father could be of mr <end> perry <end>  they were alike too 
in a general benevolence of temper  and a strong habit of regard
for every old acquaintance <end>

mr <end> john knightley was a tall  gentleman like  and very clever man 
rising in his profession  domestic  and respectable in his
private character  but with reserved manners which prevented his being
generally pleasing  and capable of being sometimes out of humour <end>
he was not an ill tempered man  not so often unreasonably cross
as to deserve such a reproach  but his temper was not his
great perfection  and  indeed  with such a worshipping wife 
it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not
be increased <end>  the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his <end>
he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted 
and he could sometimes act an ungracious  or say a severe thing <end>

he was not a great favourite with his fair sister in law <end> nothing
wrong in him escaped her <end>  she was quick in feeling the little
injuries to isabella  which isabella never felt herself <end>
perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been
flattering to isabella s sister  but they were only those of a calmly
kind brother and friend  without praise and without blindness 
but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her
regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes
fell into  the want of respectful forbearance towards her father <end>
there he had not always the patience that could have been wished <end>
mr <end> woodhouse s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking
him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill bestowed <end>
it did not often happen  for mr <end> john knightley had really a great
regard for his father in law  and generally a strong sense of what was
due to him  but it was too often for emma s charity  especially as
there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured 
though the offence came not <end>  the beginning  however  of every visit
displayed none but the properest feelings  and this being of necessity
so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality <end>
they had not been long seated and composed when mr <end> woodhouse 
with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh  called his daughter s
attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last <end>

 ah  my dear   said he   poor miss taylor  it is a grievous business <end> 

 oh yes  sir   cried she with ready sympathy   how you must
miss her   and dear emma  too   what a dreadful loss to you both   
i have been so grieved for you <end>  i could not imagine how you could
possibly do without her <end>  it is a sad change indeed <end>  but i hope
she is pretty well  sir <end> 

 pretty well  my dear  i hope  pretty well <end>  i do not know
but that the place agrees with her tolerably <end> 

mr <end> john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any
doubts of the air of randalls <end>

 oh  no  none in the least <end>  i never saw mrs <end> weston better in my life  
never looking so well <end>  papa is only speaking his own regret <end> 

 very much to the honour of both   was the handsome reply <end>

 and do you see her  sir  tolerably often   asked isabella
in the plaintive tone which just suited her father <end>

mr <end> woodhouse hesitated <end>   not near so often  my dear  as i could wish <end> 

 oh  papa  we have missed seeing them but one entire day since
they married <end>  either in the morning or evening of every day 
excepting one  have we seen either mr <end> weston or mrs <end> weston 
and generally both  either at randalls or here  and as you
may suppose  isabella  most frequently here <end>  they are very 
very kind in their visits <end>  mr <end> weston is really as kind as herself <end>
papa  if you speak in that melancholy way  you will be giving
isabella a false idea of us all <end>  every body must be aware that miss
taylor must be missed  but every body ought also to be assured
that mr <end> and mrs <end> weston do really prevent our missing her by any
means to the extent we ourselves anticipated  which is the exact truth <end> 

 just as it should be   said mr <end> john knightley   and just as i hoped
it was from your letters <end>  her wish of shewing you attention could
not be doubted  and his being a disengaged and social man makes it
all easy <end>  i have been always telling you  my love  that i had no idea
of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended 
and now you have emma s account  i hope you will be satisfied <end> 

 why  to be sure   said mr <end> woodhouse   yes  certainly  i cannot deny
that mrs <end> weston  poor mrs <end> weston  does come and see us pretty often  
but then  she is always obliged to go away again <end> 

 it would be very hard upon mr <end> weston if she did not  papa <end>  
you quite forget poor mr <end> weston <end> 

 i think  indeed   said john knightley pleasantly   that mr <end> weston
has some little claim <end>  you and i  emma  will venture to take the part
of the poor husband <end>  i  being a husband  and you not being a wife 
the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force <end>
as for isabella  she has been married long enough to see the convenience
of putting all the mr <end> westons aside as much as she can <end> 

 me  my love   cried his wife  hearing and understanding only in part <end>  
 are you talking about me   i am sure nobody ought to be  or can be 
a greater advocate for matrimony than i am  and if it had not been
for the misery of her leaving hartfield  i should never have thought
of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world 
and as to slighting mr <end> weston  that excellent mr <end> weston  i think
there is nothing he does not deserve <end>  i believe he is one of the
very best tempered men that ever existed <end>  excepting yourself
and your brother  i do not know his equal for temper <end>  i shall
never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day
last easter  and ever since his particular kindness last september
twelvemonth in writing that note  at twelve o clock at night 
on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham 
i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor
a better man in existence <end>  if any body can deserve him  it must be
miss taylor <end> 

 where is the young man   said john knightley <end>   has he been here
on this occasion  or has he not  

 he has not been here yet   replied emma <end>   there was a strong
expectation of his coming soon after the marriage  but it ended
in nothing  and i have not heard him mentioned lately <end> 

 but you should tell them of the letter  my dear   said her father <end>
 he wrote a letter to poor mrs <end> weston  to congratulate her 
and a very proper  handsome letter it was <end>  she shewed it to me <end>
i thought it very well done of him indeed <end>  whether it was his own idea
you know  one cannot tell <end>  he is but young  and his uncle  perhaps   

 my dear papa  he is three and twenty <end> you forget how time passes <end> 

 three and twenty   is he indeed   well  i could not have thought it  
and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother   well 
time does fly indeed   and my memory is very bad <end>  however  it was
an exceeding good  pretty letter  and gave mr <end> and mrs <end> weston
a great deal of pleasure <end>  i remember it was written from weymouth 
and dated sept <end> 28th  and began   my dear madam   but i forget
how it went on  and it was signed  f <end> c <end> weston churchill <end>   
i remember that perfectly <end> 

 how very pleasing and proper of him   cried the good hearted mrs <end> john
knightley <end>   i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man <end>
but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father 
there is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his
parents and natural home   i never could comprehend how mr <end> weston
could part with him <end>  to give up one s child   i really never
could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else <end> 

 nobody ever did think well of the churchills  i fancy  
observed mr <end> john knightley coolly <end>   but you need not imagine
mr <end> weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry
or john <end>  mr <end> weston is rather an easy  cheerful tempered man 
than a man of strong feelings  he takes things as he finds them 
and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other  depending  i suspect 
much more upon what is called society for his comforts  that is 
upon the power of eating and drinking  and playing whist with his
neighbours five times a week  than upon family affection  or any
thing that home affords <end> 

emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr <end> weston 
and had half a mind to take it up  but she struggled  and let
it pass <end>  she would keep the peace if possible  and there was
something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits 
the all sufficiency of home to himself  whence resulted her brother s
disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse 
and those to whom it was important <end>  it had a high claim to forbearance <end>



chapter xii


mr <end> knightley was to dine with them  rather against the inclination
of mr <end> woodhouse  who did not like that any one should share with him
in isabella s first day <end>  emma s sense of right however had decided it 
and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother 
she had particular pleasure  from the circumstance of the late
disagreement between mr <end> knightley and herself  in procuring him
the proper invitation <end>

she hoped they might now become friends again <end>  she thought it
was time to make up <end>  making up indeed would not do <end>   she  certainly
had not been in the wrong  and  he  would never own that he had <end>
concession must be out of the question  but it was time to appear
to forget that they had ever quarrelled  and she hoped it might rather
assist the restoration of friendship  that when he came into the room
she had one of the children with her  the youngest  a nice little girl
about eight months old  who was now making her first visit to hartfield 
and very happy to be danced about in her aunt s arms <end>  it did assist 
for though he began with grave looks and short questions  he was soon
led on to talk of them all in the usual way  and to take the child
out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity <end>
emma felt they were friends again  and the conviction giving
her at first great satisfaction  and then a little sauciness 
she could not help saying  as he was admiring the baby 

 what a comfort it is  that we think alike about our nephews and nieces <end>
as to men and women  our opinions are sometimes very different 
but with regard to these children  i observe we never disagree <end> 

 if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men
and women  and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your
dealings with them  as you are where these children are concerned 
we might always think alike <end> 

 to be sure  our discordancies must always arise from my being
in the wrong <end> 

 yes   said he  smiling   and reason good <end>  i was sixteen years
old when you were born <end> 

 a material difference then   she replied   and no doubt you were
much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives  but does
not the lapse of one and twenty years bring our understandings
a good deal nearer  

 yes  a good deal  nearer  <end> 

 but still  not near enough to give me a chance of being right 
if we think differently <end> 

 i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years  experience  and by
not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child <end>  come  my dear emma 
let us be friends  and say no more about it <end>  tell your aunt  little emma 
that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing
old grievances  and that if she were not wrong before  she is now <end> 

 that s true   she cried   very true <end>  little emma  grow up
a better woman than your aunt <end>  be infinitely cleverer and not
half so conceited <end>  now  mr <end> knightley  a word or two more  and i
have done <end>  as far as good intentions went  we were  both  right 
and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet
proved wrong <end>  i only want to know that mr <end> martin is not very 
very bitterly disappointed <end> 

 a man cannot be more so   was his short  full answer <end>

 ah   indeed i am very sorry <end>  come  shake hands with me <end> 

this had just taken place and with great cordiality  when john
knightley made his appearance  and  how d ye do  george   and  john 
how are you   succeeded in the true english style  burying under
a calmness that seemed all but indifference  the real attachment
which would have led either of them  if requisite  to do every thing
for the good of the other <end>

the evening was quiet and conversable  as mr <end> woodhouse declined
cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his
dear isabella  and the little party made two natural divisions 
on one side he and his daughter  on the other the two mr <end> knightleys 
their subjects totally distinct  or very rarely mixing  and emma
only occasionally joining in one or the other <end>

the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits  but principally
of those of the elder  whose temper was by much the most communicative 
and who was always the greater talker <end>  as a magistrate  he had
generally some point of law to consult john about  or  at least 
some curious anecdote to give  and as a farmer  as keeping in hand
the home farm at donwell  he had to tell what every field was to bear
next year  and to give all such local information as could not fail
of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been
the longest part of his life  and whose attachments were strong <end>
the plan of a drain  the change of a fence  the felling of a tree 
and the destination of every acre for wheat  turnips  or spring corn 
was entered into with as much equality of interest by john  as his
cooler manners rendered possible  and if his willing brother ever
left him any thing to inquire about  his inquiries even approached
a tone of eagerness <end>

while they were thus comfortably occupied  mr <end> woodhouse was enjoying
a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter <end>

 my poor dear isabella   said he  fondly taking her hand 
and interrupting  for a few moments  her busy labours for some one
of her five children   how long it is  how terribly long since you
were here   and how tired you must be after your journey   you must
go to bed early  my dear  and i recommend a little gruel to you
before you go <end>  you and i will have a nice basin of gruel together <end>
my dear emma  suppose we all have a little gruel <end> 

emma could not suppose any such thing  knowing as she did 
that both the mr <end> knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article
as herself   and two basins only were ordered <end>  after a little
more discourse in praise of gruel  with some wondering at its
not being taken every evening by every body  he proceeded to say 
with an air of grave reflection 

 it was an awkward business  my dear  your spending the autumn
at south end instead of coming here <end>  i never had much opinion
of the sea air <end> 

 mr <end> wingfield most strenuously recommended it  sir  or we
should not have gone <end>  he recommended it for all the children 
but particularly for the weakness in little bella s throat   
both sea air and bathing <end> 

 ah  my dear  but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her
any good  and as to myself  i have been long perfectly convinced 
though perhaps i never told you so before  that the sea is very
rarely of use to any body <end>  i am sure it almost killed me once <end> 

 come  come   cried emma  feeling this to be an unsafe subject   i must
beg you not to talk of the sea <end>  it makes me envious and miserable   
i who have never seen it   south end is prohibited  if you please <end>
my dear isabella  i have not heard you make one inquiry about
mr <end> perry yet  and he never forgets you <end> 

 oh  good mr <end> perry  how is he  sir  

 why  pretty well  but not quite well <end>  poor perry is bilious 
and he has not time to take care of himself  he tells me he has
not time to take care of himself  which is very sad  but he is
always wanted all round the country <end>  i suppose there is not a man
in such practice anywhere <end>  but then there is not so clever a man
any where <end> 

 and mrs <end> perry and the children  how are they  do the children grow 
i have a great regard for mr <end> perry <end>  i hope he will be calling soon <end>
he will be so pleased to see my little ones <end> 

 i hope he will be here to morrow  for i have a question or two to ask
him about myself of some consequence <end>  and  my dear  whenever he comes 
you had better let him look at little bella s throat <end> 

 oh  my dear sir  her throat is so much better that i have hardly
any uneasiness about it <end>  either bathing has been of the greatest
service to her  or else it is to be attributed to an excellent
embrocation of mr <end> wingfield s  which we have been applying
at times ever since august <end> 

 it is not very likely  my dear  that bathing should have been
of use to her  and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation 
i would have spoken to  

 you seem to me to have forgotten mrs <end> and miss bates   said emma 
 i have not heard one inquiry after them <end> 

 oh  the good bateses  i am quite ashamed of myself  but you
mention them in most of your letters <end>  i hope they are quite well <end>
good old mrs <end> bates  i will call upon her to morrow  and take
my children <end>  they are always so pleased to see my children <end>  
and that excellent miss bates   such thorough worthy people   
how are they  sir  

 why  pretty well  my dear  upon the whole <end>  but poor mrs <end> bates
had a bad cold about a month ago <end> 

 how sorry i am   but colds were never so prevalent as they have been
this autumn <end>  mr <end> wingfield told me that he has never known them
more general or heavy  except when it has been quite an influenza <end> 

 that has been a good deal the case  my dear  but not to the degree
you mention <end>  perry says that colds have been very general 
but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november <end>
perry does not call it altogether a sickly season <end> 

 no  i do not know that mr <end> wingfield considers it  very  sickly except  

 ah  my poor dear child  the truth is  that in london it is always
a sickly season <end>  nobody is healthy in london  nobody can be <end>
it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there  so far off   
and the air so bad  

 no  indeed   we  are not at all in a bad air <end>  our part of london is
very superior to most others   you must not confound us with london
in general  my dear sir <end>  the neighbourhood of brunswick square
is very different from almost all the rest <end>  we are so very airy 
i should be unwilling  i own  to live in any other part of the town   
there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my
children in   but  we  are so remarkably airy   mr <end> wingfield thinks
the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as
to air <end> 

 ah  my dear  it is not like hartfield <end>  you make the best of it  
but after you have been a week at hartfield  you are all of you
different creatures  you do not look like the same <end>  now i cannot say 
that i think you are any of you looking well at present <end> 

 i am sorry to hear you say so  sir  but i assure you  excepting those
little nervous head aches and palpitations which i am never entirely
free from anywhere  i am quite well myself  and if the children were
rather pale before they went to bed  it was only because they were
a little more tired than usual  from their journey and the happiness
of coming <end>  i hope you will think better of their looks to morrow 
for i assure you mr <end> wingfield told me  that he did not believe
he had ever sent us off altogether  in such good case <end>  i trust 
at least  that you do not think mr <end> knightley looking ill  
turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband <end>

 middling  my dear  i cannot compliment you <end>  i think mr <end> john
knightley very far from looking well <end> 

 what is the matter  sir   did you speak to me   cried mr <end> john
knightley  hearing his own name <end>

 i am sorry to find  my love  that my father does not think you
looking well  but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued <end>
i could have wished  however  as you know  that you had seen
mr <end> wingfield before you left home <end> 

 my dear isabella    exclaimed he hastily   pray do not concern
yourself about my looks <end>  be satisfied with doctoring and coddling
yourself and the children  and let me look as i chuse <end> 

 i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother  
cried emma   about your friend mr <end> graham s intending to have a bailiff
from scotland  to look after his new estate <end>  what will it answer 
will not the old prejudice be too strong  

and she talked in this way so long and successfully that  when forced
to give her attention again to her father and sister  she had nothing
worse to hear than isabella s kind inquiry after jane fairfax 
and jane fairfax  though no great favourite with her in general 
she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising <end>

 that sweet  amiable jane fairfax   said mrs <end> john knightley <end>  
 it is so long since i have seen her  except now and then for a moment
accidentally in town   what happiness it must be to her good old
grandmother and excellent aunt  when she comes to visit them 
i always regret excessively on dear emma s account that she cannot
be more at highbury  but now their daughter is married  i suppose
colonel and mrs <end> campbell will not be able to part with her at all <end>
she would be such a delightful companion for emma <end> 

mr <end> woodhouse agreed to it all  but added 

 our little friend harriet smith  however  is just such another
pretty kind of young person <end>  you will like harriet <end>  emma could
not have a better companion than harriet <end> 

 i am most happy to hear it  but only jane fairfax one knows to be
so very accomplished and superior   and exactly emma s age <end> 

this topic was discussed very happily  and others succeeded of
similar moment  and passed away with similar harmony  but the evening
did not close without a little return of agitation <end>  the gruel came
and supplied a great deal to be said  much praise and many comments  
undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution 
and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was
never met with tolerable   but  unfortunately  among the failures
which the daughter had to instance  the most recent  and therefore
most prominent  was in her own cook at south end  a young woman
hired for the time  who never had been able to understand what she
meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel  thin  but not too thin <end>
often as she had wished for and ordered it  she had never been able
to get any thing tolerable <end>  here was a dangerous opening <end>

 ah   said mr <end> woodhouse  shaking his head and fixing his eyes on
her with tender concern <end>  the ejaculation in emma s ear expressed 
 ah  there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to
south end <end>  it does not bear talking of <end>   and for a little while
she hoped he would not talk of it  and that a silent rumination
might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel <end>
after an interval of some minutes  however  he began with 

 i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn 
instead of coming here <end> 

 but why should you be sorry  sir   i assure you  it did the children
a great deal of good <end> 

 and  moreover  if you must go to the sea  it had better not
have been to south end <end>  south end is an unhealthy place <end>
perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end <end> 

 i know there is such an idea with many people  but indeed it is
quite a mistake  sir <end>  we all had our health perfectly well there 
never found the least inconvenience from the mud  and mr <end> wingfield
says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy 
and i am sure he may be depended on  for he thoroughly understands
the nature of the air  and his own brother and family have been
there repeatedly <end> 

 you should have gone to cromer  my dear  if you went anywhere <end>  
perry was a week at cromer once  and he holds it to be the best
of all the sea bathing places <end>  a fine open sea  he says  and very
pure air <end>  and  by what i understand  you might have had lodgings there
quite away from the sea  a quarter of a mile off  very comfortable <end>
you should have consulted perry <end> 

 but  my dear sir  the difference of the journey   only consider how
great it would have been <end>  an hundred miles  perhaps  instead of forty <end> 

 ah  my dear  as perry says  where health is at stake  nothing else
should be considered  and if one is to travel  there is not much
to chuse between forty miles and an hundred <end>  better not move at all 
better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get
into a worse air <end>  this is just what perry said <end>  it seemed to him
a very ill judged measure <end> 

emma s attempts to stop her father had been vain  and when he
had reached such a point as this  she could not wonder at her
brother in law s breaking out <end>

 mr <end> perry   said he  in a voice of very strong displeasure 
 would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for <end>
why does he make it any business of his  to wonder at what i do   
at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another   i may
be allowed  i hope  the use of my judgment as well as mr <end> perry <end>  
i want his directions no more than his drugs <end>   he paused  
and growing cooler in a moment  added  with only sarcastic dryness 
 if mr <end> perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children
a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense
or inconvenience than a distance of forty  i should be as willing to
prefer cromer to south end as he could himself <end> 

 true  true   cried mr <end> knightley  with most ready interposition  
 very true <end>  that s a consideration indeed <end>  but john  as to what i
was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham  of turning
it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows 
i cannot conceive any difficulty <end>  i should not attempt it 
if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people 
but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path <end>  <end>  <end>  <end>
the only way of proving it  however  will be to turn to our maps <end>
i shall see you at the abbey to morrow morning i hope  and then we
will look them over  and you shall give me your opinion <end> 

mr <end> woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on
his friend perry  to whom he had  in fact  though unconsciously 
been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions   
but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed
the present evil  and the immediate alertness of one brother 
and better recollections of the other  prevented any renewal of it <end>



chapter xiii


there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs <end> john
knightley  in this short visit to hartfield  going about every morning
among her old acquaintance with her five children  and talking
over what she had done every evening with her father and sister <end>
she had nothing to wish otherwise  but that the days did not pass
so swiftly <end>  it was a delightful visit   perfect  in being much too short <end>

in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than
their mornings  but one complete dinner engagement  and out
of the house too  there was no avoiding  though at christmas <end>
mr <end> weston would take no denial  they must all dine at randalls
one day   even mr <end> woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible
thing in preference to a division of the party <end>

how they were all to be conveyed  he would have made a difficulty
if he could  but as his son and daughter s carriage and horses
were actually at hartfield  he was not able to make more than
a simple question on that head  it hardly amounted to a doubt 
nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one
of the carriages find room for harriet also <end>

harriet  mr <end> elton  and mr <end> knightley  their own especial set 
were the only persons invited to meet them   the hours were to be early 
as well as the numbers few  mr <end> woodhouse s habits and inclination
being consulted in every thing <end>

the evening before this great event  for it was a very great event
that mr <end> woodhouse should dine out  on the 24th of december  had been
spent by harriet at hartfield  and she had gone home so much indisposed
with a cold  that  but for her own earnest wish of being nursed
by mrs <end> goddard  emma could not have allowed her to leave the house <end>
emma called on her the next day  and found her doom already signed
with regard to randalls <end>  she was very feverish and had a bad
sore throat   mrs <end> goddard was full of care and affection  mr <end> perry
was talked of  and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist
the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement 
though she could not speak of her loss without many tears <end>

emma sat with her as long as she could  to attend her in mrs <end> goddard s
unavoidable absences  and raise her spirits by representing how much
mr <end> elton s would be depressed when he knew her state  and left her
at last tolerably comfortable  in the sweet dependence of his having
a most comfortless visit  and of their all missing her very much <end>
she had not advanced many yards from mrs <end> goddard s door  when she
was met by mr <end> elton himself  evidently coming towards it  and as
they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid  
of whom he  on the rumour of considerable illness  had been going
to inquire  that he might carry some report of her to hartfield  
they were overtaken by mr <end> john knightley returning from the
daily visit to donwell  with his two eldest boys  whose healthy 
glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run  and seemed
to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they
were hastening home for <end>  they joined company and proceeded together <end>
emma was just describing the nature of her friend s complaint   
 a throat very much inflamed  with a great deal of heat about her 
a quick  low pulse   c <end>  and she was sorry to find from mrs <end> goddard
that harriet was liable to very bad sore throats  and had often
alarmed her with them <end>   mr <end> elton looked all alarm on the occasion 
as he exclaimed 

 a sore throat   i hope not infectious <end>  i hope not of a putrid
infectious sort <end>  has perry seen her   indeed you should take care
of yourself as well as of your friend <end>  let me entreat you to run
no risks <end>  why does not perry see her  

emma  who was not really at all frightened herself  tranquillised this
excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs <end> goddard s experience
and care  but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness
which she could not wish to reason away  which she would rather
feed and assist than not  she added soon afterwards  as if quite
another subject 

 it is so cold  so very cold  and looks and feels so very much
like snow  that if it were to any other place or with any other party 
i should really try not to go out to day  and dissuade my father
from venturing  but as he has made up his mind  and does not seem
to feel the cold himself  i do not like to interfere  as i know it
would be so great a disappointment to mr <end> and mrs <end> weston <end>  but  upon
my word  mr <end> elton  in your case  i should certainly excuse myself <end>
you appear to me a little hoarse already  and when you consider
what demand of voice and what fatigues to morrow will bring 
i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home
and take care of yourself to night <end> 

mr <end> elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make 
which was exactly the case  for though very much gratified by the kind
care of such a fair lady  and not liking to resist any advice of
her s  he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit   
but emma  too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions
and views to hear him impartially  or see him with clear vision 
was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its
being  very cold  certainly very cold   and walked on  rejoicing in
having extricated him from randalls  and secured him the power
of sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening <end>

 you do quite right   said she    we will make your apologies
to mr <end> and mrs <end> weston <end> 

but hardly had she so spoken  when she found her brother was civilly
offering a seat in his carriage  if the weather were mr <end> elton s
only objection  and mr <end> elton actually accepting the offer with much
prompt satisfaction <end>  it was a done thing  mr <end> elton was to go 
and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than
at this moment  never had his smile been stronger  nor his eyes
more exulting than when he next looked at her <end>

 well   said she to herself   this is most strange   after i
had got him off so well  to chuse to go into company  and leave
harriet ill behind   most strange indeed   but there is  i believe 
in many men  especially single men  such an inclination  
such a passion for dining out  a dinner engagement is so high in
the class of their pleasures  their employments  their dignities 
almost their duties  that any thing gives way to it  and this must
be the case with mr <end> elton  a most valuable  amiable  pleasing young
man undoubtedly  and very much in love with harriet  but still 
he cannot refuse an invitation  he must dine out wherever he is asked <end>
what a strange thing love is  he can see ready wit in harriet 
but will not dine alone for her <end> 

soon afterwards mr <end> elton quitted them  and she could not but do him
the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment
in his manner of naming harriet at parting  in the tone of his
voice while assuring her that he should call at mrs <end> goddard s
for news of her fair friend  the last thing before he prepared
for the happiness of meeting her again  when he hoped to be
able to give a better report  and he sighed and smiled himself
off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour <end>

after a few minutes of entire silence between them  john knightley
began with  

 i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than
mr <end> elton <end>  it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned <end>
with men he can be rational and unaffected  but when he has ladies
to please  every feature works <end> 

 mr <end> elton s manners are not perfect   replied emma   but where there
is a wish to please  one ought to overlook  and one does overlook
a great deal <end>  where a man does his best with only moderate powers 
he will have the advantage over negligent superiority <end>  there is
such perfect good temper and good will in mr <end> elton as one cannot
but value <end> 

 yes   said mr <end> john knightley presently  with some slyness 
 he seems to have a great deal of good will towards you <end> 

 me   she replied with a smile of astonishment   are you imagining
me to be mr <end> elton s object  

 such an imagination has crossed me  i own  emma  and if it never
occurred to you before  you may as well take it into consideration now <end> 

 mr <end> elton in love with me   what an idea  

 i do not say it is so  but you will do well to consider whether
it is so or not  and to regulate your behaviour accordingly <end>
i think your manners to him encouraging <end>  i speak as a friend 
emma <end>  you had better look about you  and ascertain what you do 
and what you mean to do <end> 

 i thank you  but i assure you you are quite mistaken <end>  mr <end> elton
and i are very good friends  and nothing more   and she walked on 
amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often
arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances  of the mistakes
which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into 
and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind
and ignorant  and in want of counsel <end>  he said no more <end>

mr <end> woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit 
that in spite of the increasing coldness  he seemed to have no idea
of shrinking from it  and set forward at last most punctually
with his eldest daughter in his own carriage  with less apparent
consciousness of the weather than either of the others  too full
of the wonder of his own going  and the pleasure it was to afford at
randalls to see that it was cold  and too well wrapt up to feel it <end>
the cold  however  was severe  and by the time the second carriage
was in motion  a few flakes of snow were finding their way down 
and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only
a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time <end>

emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour <end>
the preparing and the going abroad in such weather  with the sacrifice
of his children after dinner  were evils  were disagreeables at least 
which mr <end> john knightley did not by any means like  he anticipated
nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase 
and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in
expressing his discontent <end>

 a man   said he   must have a very good opinion of himself when
he asks people to leave their own fireside  and encounter such
a day as this  for the sake of coming to see him <end>  he must think
himself a most agreeable fellow  i could not do such a thing <end>
it is the greatest absurdity  actually snowing at this moment   
the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home  and the
folly of people s not staying comfortably at home when they can 
if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this  by any call of
duty or business  what a hardship we should deem it   and here are we 
probably with rather thinner clothing than usual  setting forward
voluntarily  without excuse  in defiance of the voice of nature 
which tells man  in every thing given to his view or his feelings 
to stay at home himself  and keep all under shelter that he can   
here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another
man s house  with nothing to say or to hear that was not said
and heard yesterday  and may not be said and heard again to morrow <end>
going in dismal weather  to return probably in worse   four horses
and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle 
shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they
might have had at home <end> 

emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent  which no doubt
he was in the habit of receiving  to emulate the  very true  my love  
which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion 
but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer
at all <end>  she could not be complying  she dreaded being quarrelsome 
her heroism reached only to silence <end>  she allowed him to talk 
and arranged the glasses  and wrapped herself up  without opening
her lips <end>

they arrived  the carriage turned  the step was let down 
and mr <end> elton  spruce  black  and smiling  was with them instantly <end>
emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject <end>  mr <end> elton
was all obligation and cheerfulness  he was so very cheerful
in his civilities indeed  that she began to think he must have
received a different account of harriet from what had reached her <end>
she had sent while dressing  and the answer had been   much the same  
not better <end> 

  my  report from mrs <end> goddard s   said she presently   was not
so pleasant as i had hoped   not better  was  my  answer <end> 

his face lengthened immediately  and his voice was the voice
of sentiment as he answered <end>

 oh  no  i am grieved to find  i was on the point of telling you that
when i called at mrs <end> goddard s door  which i did the very last thing
before i returned to dress  i was told that miss smith was not better 
by no means better  rather worse <end>  very much grieved and concerned  
i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial
as i knew had been given her in the morning <end> 

emma smiled and answered   my visit was of use to the nervous part
of her complaint  i hope  but not even i can charm away a sore throat 
it is a most severe cold indeed <end>  mr <end> perry has been with her 
as you probably heard <end> 

 yes  i imagined  that is  i did not   

 he has been used to her in these complaints  and i hope to morrow
morning will bring us both a more comfortable report <end>  but it is
impossible not to feel uneasiness <end>  such a sad loss to our party to day  

 dreadful   exactly so  indeed <end>  she will be missed every moment <end> 

this was very proper  the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable 
but it should have lasted longer <end>  emma was rather in dismay when
only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things 
and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment <end>

 what an excellent device   said he   the use of a sheepskin
for carriages <end>  how very comfortable they make it   impossible to
feel cold with such precautions <end>  the contrivances of modern days
indeed have rendered a gentleman s carriage perfectly complete <end>
one is so fenced and guarded from the weather  that not a breath
of air can find its way unpermitted <end>  weather becomes absolutely
of no consequence <end>  it is a very cold afternoon  but in this carriage
we know nothing of the matter <end>  ha  snows a little i see <end> 

 yes   said john knightley   and i think we shall have a good deal
of it <end> 

 christmas weather   observed mr <end> elton <end>   quite seasonable 
and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not
begin yesterday  and prevent this day s party  which it might very
possibly have done  for mr <end> woodhouse would hardly have ventured had
there been much snow on the ground  but now it is of no consequence <end>
this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings <end>  at christmas
every body invites their friends about them  and people think little
of even the worst weather <end>  i was snowed up at a friend s house once
for a week <end>  nothing could be pleasanter <end>  i went for only one night 
and could not get away till that very day se nnight <end> 

mr <end> john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure 
but said only  coolly 

 i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls <end> 

at another time emma might have been amused  but she was too
much astonished now at mr <end> elton s spirits for other feelings <end>
harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party <end>

 we are sure of excellent fires   continued he   and every thing
in the greatest comfort <end>  charming people  mr <end> and mrs <end> weston   
mrs <end> weston indeed is much beyond praise  and he is exactly
what one values  so hospitable  and so fond of society   
it will be a small party  but where small parties are select 
they are perhaps the most agreeable of any <end>  mr <end> weston s dining room
does not accommodate more than ten comfortably  and for my part 
i would rather  under such circumstances  fall short by two than
exceed by two <end>  i think you will agree with me   turning with a soft
air to emma   i think i shall certainly have your approbation 
though mr <end> knightley perhaps  from being used to the large parties
of london  may not quite enter into our feelings <end> 

 i know nothing of the large parties of london  sir  i never dine
with any body <end> 

 indeed   in a tone of wonder and pity   i had no idea that the
law had been so great a slavery <end>  well  sir  the time must come
when you will be paid for all this  when you will have little
labour and great enjoyment <end> 

 my first enjoyment   replied john knightley  as they passed through
the sweep gate   will be to find myself safe at hartfield again <end> 



chapter xiv


some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman
as they walked into mrs <end> weston s drawing room   mr <end> elton must
compose his joyous looks  and mr <end> john knightley disperse his
ill humour <end> mr <end> elton must smile less  and mr <end> john knightley more 
to fit them for the place <end>  emma only might be as nature prompted 
and shew herself just as happy as she was <end>  to her it was real
enjoyment to be with the westons <end>  mr <end> weston was a great favourite 
and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with
such unreserve  as to his wife  not any one  to whom she related
with such conviction of being listened to and understood  of being
always interesting and always intelligible  the little affairs 
arrangements  perplexities  and pleasures of her father and herself <end>
she could tell nothing of hartfield  in which mrs <end> weston had not
a lively concern  and half an hour s uninterrupted communication
of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private
life depends  was one of the first gratifications of each <end>

this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day s visit might
not afford  which certainly did not belong to the present half hour 
but the very sight of mrs <end> weston  her smile  her touch  her voice
was grateful to emma  and she determined to think as little as
possible of mr <end> elton s oddities  or of any thing else unpleasant 
and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost <end>

the misfortune of harriet s cold had been pretty well gone through
before her arrival <end>  mr <end> woodhouse had been safely seated long
enough to give the history of it  besides all the history of his own
and isabella s coming  and of emma s being to follow  and had indeed
just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come
and see his daughter  when the others appeared  and mrs <end> weston 
who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him 
was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma <end>

emma s project of forgetting mr <end> elton for a while made her rather
sorry to find  when they had all taken their places  that he was
close to her <end>  the difficulty was great of driving his strange
insensibility towards harriet  from her mind  while he not only sat
at her elbow  but was continually obtruding his happy countenance
on her notice  and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion <end>
instead of forgetting him  his behaviour was such that she could
not avoid the internal suggestion of  can it really be as my brother
imagined  can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer
his affections from harriet to me   absurd and insufferable    
yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm  would be
so interested about her father  and so delighted with mrs <end> weston 
and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal
and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would be lover 
and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners <end>
for her own sake she could not be rude  and for harriet s  in the hope
that all would yet turn out right  she was even positively civil 
but it was an effort  especially as something was going on amongst
the others  in the most overpowering period of mr <end> elton s nonsense 
which she particularly wished to listen to <end>  she heard enough
to know that mr <end> weston was giving some information about his son 
she heard the words  my son   and  frank   and  my son  
repeated several times over  and  from a few other half syllables
very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from
his son  but before she could quiet mr <end> elton  the subject was
so completely past that any reviving question from her would have
been awkward <end>

now  it so happened that in spite of emma s resolution of never marrying 
there was something in the name  in the idea of mr <end> frank churchill 
which always interested her <end>  she had frequently thought  especially since
his father s marriage with miss taylor  that if she  were  to marry 
he was the very person to suit her in age  character and condition <end>
he seemed by this connexion between the families  quite to belong to her <end>
she could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew
them must think of <end>  that mr <end> and mrs <end> weston did think of it  she was
very strongly persuaded  and though not meaning to be induced by him 
or by any body else  to give up a situation which she believed more
replete with good than any she could change it for  she had a great
curiosity to see him  a decided intention of finding him pleasant 
of being liked by him to a certain degree  and a sort of pleasure
in the idea of their being coupled in their friends  imaginations <end>

with such sensations  mr <end> elton s civilities were dreadfully ill timed 
but she had the comfort of appearing very polite  while feeling
very cross  and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not
possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again 
or the substance of it  from the open hearted mr <end> weston <end>  so it proved   
for when happily released from mr <end> elton  and seated by mr <end> weston 
at dinner  he made use of the very first interval in the cares
of hospitality  the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton 
to say to her 

 we want only two more to be just the right number <end>  i should
like to see two more here   your pretty little friend  miss smith 
and my son  and then i should say we were quite complete <end>
i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing room
that we are expecting frank <end>  i had a letter from him this morning 
and he will be with us within a fortnight <end> 

emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure  and fully assented
to his proposition of mr <end> frank churchill and miss smith making
their party quite complete <end>

 he has been wanting to come to us   continued mr <end> weston 
 ever since september   every letter has been full of it 
but he cannot command his own time <end>  he has those to please
who must be pleased  and who  between ourselves  are sometimes
to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices <end>  but now
i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january <end> 

 what a very great pleasure it will be to you  and mrs <end> weston
is so anxious to be acquainted with him  that she must be almost
as happy as yourself <end> 

 yes  she would be  but that she thinks there will be another
put off <end> she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do 
but she does not know the parties so well as i do <end>  the case 
you see  is   but this is quite between ourselves   i did not mention
a syllable of it in the other room <end>  there are secrets in all families 
you know   the case is  that a party of friends are invited to pay
a visit at enscombe in january  and that frank s coming depends upon
their being put off <end>  if they are not put off  he cannot stir <end>
but i know they will  because it is a family that a certain lady 
of some consequence  at enscombe  has a particular dislike to 
and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or
three years  they always are put off when it comes to the point <end>
i have not the smallest doubt of the issue <end>  i am as confident
of seeing frank here before the middle of january  as i am
of being here myself   but your good friend there  nodding
towards the upper end of the table  has so few vagaries herself 
and has been so little used to them at hartfield  that she cannot
calculate on their effects  as i have been long in the practice
of doing <end> 

 i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case  
replied emma   but am disposed to side with you  mr <end> weston <end>  if you
think he will come  i shall think so too  for you know enscombe <end> 

 yes  i have some right to that knowledge  though i have never been
at the place in my life <end>  she is an odd woman   but i never allow
myself to speak ill of her  on frank s account  for i do believe
her to be very fond of him <end>  i used to think she was not capable
of being fond of any body  except herself   but she has always been
kind to him  in her way  allowing for little whims and caprices 
and expecting every thing to be as she likes  <end> and it is no small credit 
in my opinion  to him  that he should excite such an affection 
for  though i would not say it to any body else  she has no more
heart than a stone to people in general  and the devil of a temper <end> 

emma liked the subject so well  that she began upon it  to mrs <end> weston 
very soon after their moving into the drawing room  wishing her joy  
yet observing  that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming <end>  
mrs <end> weston agreed to it  but added  that she should be very
glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting
at the time talked of    for i cannot depend upon his coming <end>
i cannot be so sanguine as mr <end> weston <end>  i am very much afraid
that it will all end in nothing <end>  mr <end> weston  i dare say  has been
telling you exactly how the matter stands  

 yes  it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour
of mrs <end> churchill  which i imagine to be the most certain
thing in the world <end> 

 my emma   replied mrs <end> weston  smiling   what is the certainty
of caprice    then turning to isabella  who had not been
attending before   you must know  my dear mrs <end> knightley 
that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr <end> frank churchill 
in my opinion  as his father thinks <end>  it depends entirely upon
his aunt s spirits and pleasure  in short  upon her temper <end>
to you  to my two daughters  i may venture on the truth <end>
mrs <end> churchill rules at enscombe  and is a very odd tempered woman 
and his coming now  depends upon her being willing to spare him <end> 

 oh  mrs <end> churchill  every body knows mrs <end> churchill  
replied isabella    and i am sure i never think of that poor young
man without the greatest compassion <end>  to be constantly living
with an ill tempered person  must be dreadful <end>  it is what we
happily have never known any thing of  but it must be a life
of misery <end>  what a blessing  that she never had any children 
poor little creatures  how unhappy she would have made them  

emma wished she had been alone with mrs <end> weston <end>  she should then have
heard more   mrs <end> weston would speak to her  with a degree of unreserve
which she would not hazard with isabella  and  she really believed 
would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills
from her  excepting those views on the young man  of which her own
imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge <end>
but at present there was nothing more to be said <end>  mr <end> woodhouse
very soon followed them into the drawing room <end> to be sitting
long after dinner  was a confinement that he could not endure <end>
neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him  and gladly did
he move to those with whom he was always comfortable <end>

while he talked to isabella  however  emma found an opportunity
of saying 

 and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any
means certain <end>  i am sorry for it <end>  the introduction must be unpleasant 
whenever it takes place  and the sooner it could be over  the better <end> 

 yes  and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays <end>
even if this family  the braithwaites  are put off  i am still
afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us <end>
i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side  but i am sure
there is a great wish on the churchills  to keep him to themselves <end>
there is jealousy <end>  they are jealous even of his regard for his father <end>
in short  i can feel no dependence on his coming  and i wish mr <end> weston
were less sanguine <end> 

 he ought to come   said emma <end>   if he could stay only a couple
of days  he ought to come  and one can hardly conceive a young man s
not having it in his power to do as much as that <end>  a young  woman  
if she fall into bad hands  may be teazed  and kept at a distance
from those she wants to be with  but one cannot comprehend a young
 man  s being under such restraint  as not to be able to spend a week
with his father  if he likes it <end> 

 one ought to be at enscombe  and know the ways of the family 
before one decides upon what he can do   replied mrs <end> weston <end>
 one ought to use the same caution  perhaps  in judging of the
conduct of any one individual of any one family  but enscombe 
i believe  certainly must not be judged by general rules 
 she  is so very unreasonable  and every thing gives way to her <end> 

 but she is so fond of the nephew   he is so very great a favourite <end>
now  according to my idea of mrs <end> churchill  it would be most natural 
that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband 
to whom she owes every thing  while she exercises incessant caprice
towards  him   she should frequently be governed by the nephew 
to whom she owes nothing at all <end> 

 my dearest emma  do not pretend  with your sweet temper 
to understand a bad one  or to lay down rules for it   you must
let it go its own way <end>  i have no doubt of his having  at times 
considerable influence  but it may be perfectly impossible for him
to know beforehand  when  it will be <end> 

emma listened  and then coolly said   i shall not be satisfied 
unless he comes <end> 

 he may have a great deal of influence on some points  
continued mrs <end> weston   and on others  very little   and among those 
on which she is beyond his reach  it is but too likely  may be
this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us <end> 



chapter xv


mr <end> woodhouse was soon ready for his tea  and when he had drank his
tea he was quite ready to go home  and it was as much as his three
companions could do  to entertain away his notice of the lateness
of the hour  before the other gentlemen appeared <end>  mr <end> weston was
chatty and convivial  and no friend to early separations of any sort 
but at last the drawing room party did receive an augmentation <end>
mr <end> elton  in very good spirits  was one of the first to walk in <end>
mrs <end> weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa <end>  he joined
them immediately  and  with scarcely an invitation  seated himself
between them <end>

emma  in good spirits too  from the amusement afforded her mind
by the expectation of mr <end> frank churchill  was willing to forget
his late improprieties  and be as well satisfied with him as before 
and on his making harriet his very first subject  was ready to listen
with most friendly smiles <end>

he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend  
her fair  lovely  amiable friend <end>   did she know   had she
heard any thing about her  since their being at randalls   
he felt much anxiety  he must confess that the nature of her
complaint alarmed him considerably <end>   and in this style he talked
on for some time very properly  not much attending to any answer 
but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat 
and emma was quite in charity with him <end>

but at last there seemed a perverse turn  it seemed all at once as if
he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account 
than on harriet s  more anxious that she should escape the infection 
than that there should be no infection in the complaint <end>  he began
with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting
the sick chamber again  for the present  to entreat her to  promise 
 him  not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr <end> perry
and learnt his opinion  and though she tried to laugh it off
and bring the subject back into its proper course  there was no
putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her <end>  she was vexed <end>
it did appear  there was no concealing it  exactly like the pretence
of being in love with her  instead of harriet  an inconstancy 
if real  the most contemptible and abominable  and she had difficulty
in behaving with temper <end>  he turned to mrs <end> weston to implore
her assistance   would not she give him her support   would not she
add her persuasions to his  to induce miss woodhouse not to go
to mrs <end> goddard s till it were certain that miss smith s disorder
had no infection   he could not be satisfied without a promise  
would not she give him her influence in procuring it  

 so scrupulous for others   he continued   and yet so careless
for herself   she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to day 
and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated
sore throat herself <end>  is this fair  mrs <end> weston   judge between us <end>
have not i some right to complain   i am sure of your kind support
and aid <end> 

emma saw mrs <end> weston s surprize  and felt that it must be great 
at an address which  in words and manner  was assuming to himself
the right of first interest in her  and as for herself  she was
too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly
saying any thing to the purpose <end>  she could only give him a look 
but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses 
and then left the sofa  removing to a seat by her sister  and giving
her all her attention <end>

she had not time to know how mr <end> elton took the reproof  so rapidly
did another subject succeed  for mr <end> john knightley now came
into the room from examining the weather  and opened on them
all with the information of the ground being covered with snow 
and of its still snowing fast  with a strong drifting wind 
concluding with these words to mr <end> woodhouse 

 this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements 
sir <end>  something new for your coachman and horses to be making
their way through a storm of snow <end> 

poor mr <end> woodhouse was silent from consternation  but every body else
had something to say  every body was either surprized or not surprized 
and had some question to ask  or some comfort to offer <end>  mrs <end> weston
and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention
from his son in law  who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly <end>

 i admired your resolution very much  sir   said he   in venturing
out in such weather  for of course you saw there would be snow
very soon <end>  every body must have seen the snow coming on <end>
i admired your spirit  and i dare say we shall get home very well <end>
another hour or two s snow can hardly make the road impassable 
and we are two carriages  if one is blown over in the bleak part
of the common field there will be the other at hand <end>  i dare say we
shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight <end> 

mr <end> weston  with triumph of a different sort  was confessing that he
had known it to be snowing some time  but had not said a word 
lest it should make mr <end> woodhouse uncomfortable  and be an excuse
for his hurrying away <end>  as to there being any quantity of snow fallen
or likely to fall to impede their return  that was a mere joke 
he was afraid they would find no difficulty <end>  he wished the road might
be impassable  that he might be able to keep them all at randalls 
and with the utmost good will was sure that accommodation might
be found for every body  calling on his wife to agree with him 
that with a little contrivance  every body might be lodged 
which she hardly knew how to do  from the consciousness of there
being but two spare rooms in the house <end>

 what is to be done  my dear emma   what is to be done  
was mr <end> woodhouse s first exclamation  and all that he could say
for some time <end>  to her he looked for comfort  and her assurances
of safety  her representation of the excellence of the horses 
and of james  and of their having so many friends about them 
revived him a little <end>

his eldest daughter s alarm was equal to his own <end>  the horror of
being blocked up at randalls  while her children were at hartfield 
was full in her imagination  and fancying the road to be now just
passable for adventurous people  but in a state that admitted no delay 
she was eager to have it settled  that her father and emma should remain
at randalls  while she and her husband set forward instantly through
all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them <end>

 you had better order the carriage directly  my love   said she 
 i dare say we shall be able to get along  if we set off directly 
and if we do come to any thing very bad  i can get out and walk <end>
i am not at all afraid <end>  i should not mind walking half the way <end>
i could change my shoes  you know  the moment i got home  and it is not
the sort of thing that gives me cold <end> 

 indeed   replied he <end>   then  my dear isabella  it is the most
extraordinary sort of thing in the world  for in general every
thing does give you cold <end>  walk home   you are prettily shod
for walking home  i dare say <end>  it will be bad enough for the horses <end> 

isabella turned to mrs <end> weston for her approbation of the plan <end>
mrs <end> weston could only approve <end>  isabella then went to emma 
but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being
all able to get away  and they were still discussing the point 
when mr <end> knightley  who had left the room immediately after his
brother s first report of the snow  came back again  and told them
that he had been out of doors to examine  and could answer for there
not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home  whenever they
liked it  either now or an hour hence <end>  he had gone beyond the sweep  
some way along the highbury road  the snow was nowhere above half
an inch deep  in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground 
a very few flakes were falling at present  but the clouds were parting 
and there was every appearance of its being soon over <end>  he had seen
the coachmen  and they both agreed with him in there being nothing
to apprehend <end>

to isabella  the relief of such tidings was very great  and they
were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her father s account 
who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous
constitution allowed  but the alarm that had been raised could not
be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued
at randalls <end>  he was satisfied of there being no present danger in
returning home  but no assurances could convince him that it was safe
to stay  and while the others were variously urging and recommending 
mr <end> knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences   thus  

 your father will not be easy  why do not you go  

 i am ready  if the others are <end> 

 shall i ring the bell  

 yes  do <end> 

and the bell was rung  and the carriages spoken for <end>  a few
minutes more  and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion
deposited in his own house  to get sober and cool  and the other
recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over <end>

the carriage came   and mr <end> woodhouse  always the first object on
such occasions  was carefully attended to his own by mr <end> knightley
and mr <end> weston  but not all that either could say could prevent some
renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen 
and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for <end>
 he was afraid they should have a very bad drive <end>  he was afraid
poor isabella would not like it <end>  and there would be poor emma
in the carriage behind <end>  he did not know what they had best do <end>
they must keep as much together as they could   and james was talked to 
and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage <end>

isabella stept in after her father  john knightley  forgetting that he
did not belong to their party  stept in after his wife very naturally 
so that emma found  on being escorted and followed into the second
carriage by mr <end> elton  that the door was to be lawfully shut on them 
and that they were to have a tete a tete drive <end>  it would not have been
the awkwardness of a moment  it would have been rather a pleasure 
previous to the suspicions of this very day  she could have talked
to him of harriet  and the three quarters of a mile would have
seemed but one <end>  but now  she would rather it had not happened <end>
she believed he had been drinking too much of mr <end> weston s good wine 
and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense <end>

to restrain him as much as might be  by her own manners  she was
immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity
of the weather and the night  but scarcely had she begun  scarcely had
they passed the sweep gate and joined the other carriage  than she
found her subject cut up  her hand seized  her attention demanded 
and mr <end> elton actually making violent love to her   availing himself
of the precious opportunity  declaring sentiments which must be already
well known  hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him 
but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled
love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect 
and in short  very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon
as possible <end>  it really was so <end>  without scruple  without apology  
without much apparent diffidence  mr <end> elton  the lover of harriet 
was professing himself  her  lover <end>  she tried to stop him  but vainly 
he would go on  and say it all <end>  angry as she was  the thought of
the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak <end>
she felt that half this folly must be drunkenness  and therefore
could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour <end>
accordingly  with a mixture of the serious and the playful  which she
hoped would best suit his half and half state  she replied 

 i am very much astonished  mr <end> elton <end>  this to  me   you forget yourself  
you take me for my friend  any message to miss smith i shall
be happy to deliver  but no more of this to  me   if you please <end> 

 miss smith   message to miss smith   what could she possibly mean    
and he repeated her words with such assurance of accent  such boastful
pretence of amazement  that she could not help replying with quickness 

 mr <end> elton  this is the most extraordinary conduct  and i can account
for it only in one way  you are not yourself  or you could not speak
either to me  or of harriet  in such a manner <end>  command yourself
enough to say no more  and i will endeavour to forget it <end> 

but mr <end> elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits 
not at all to confuse his intellects <end>  he perfectly knew his own meaning 
and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious 
and slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friend   
but acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned
at all   he resumed the subject of his own passion  and was very
urgent for a favourable answer <end>

as she thought less of his inebriety  she thought more of his inconstancy
and presumption  and with fewer struggles for politeness  replied 

 it is impossible for me to doubt any longer <end>  you have made
yourself too clear <end>  mr <end> elton  my astonishment is much beyond
any thing i can express <end>  after such behaviour  as i have witnessed
during the last month  to miss smith  such attentions as i
have been in the daily habit of observing  to be addressing me
in this manner  this is an unsteadiness of character  indeed 
which i had not supposed possible   believe me  sir  i am far 
very far  from gratified in being the object of such professions <end> 

 good heaven   cried mr <end> elton   what can be the meaning of this   
miss smith   i never thought of miss smith in the whole course
of my existence  never paid her any attentions  but as your friend 
never cared whether she were dead or alive  but as your friend <end>
if she has fancied otherwise  her own wishes have misled her 
and i am very sorry  extremely sorry  but  miss smith  indeed   oh 
miss woodhouse  who can think of miss smith  when miss woodhouse
is near   no  upon my honour  there is no unsteadiness of character <end>
i have thought only of you <end>  i protest against having paid the smallest
attention to any one else <end>  every thing that i have said or done 
for many weeks past  has been with the sole view of marking my
adoration of yourself <end>  you cannot really  seriously  doubt it <end>
no    in an accent meant to be insinuating   i am sure you have seen
and understood me <end> 

it would be impossible to say what emma felt  on hearing this  
which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost <end>  she was
too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply 
and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr <end> elton s
sanguine state of mind  he tried to take her hand again  as he
joyously exclaimed  

 charming miss woodhouse  allow me to interpret this interesting silence <end>
it confesses that you have long understood me <end> 

 no  sir   cried emma   it confesses no such thing <end>  so far from
having long understood you  i have been in a most complete error
with respect to your views  till this moment <end>  as to myself  i am
very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings  
nothing could be farther from my wishes  your attachment to my
friend harriet  your pursuit of her   pursuit  it appeared   gave me
great pleasure  and i have been very earnestly wishing you success 
but had i supposed that she were not your attraction to hartfield 
i should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits
so frequent <end>  am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend
yourself particularly to miss smith   that you have never thought
seriously of her  

 never  madam   cried he  affronted in his turn    never  i assure you <end>
 i  think seriously of miss smith   miss smith is a very good sort
of girl  and i should be happy to see her respectably settled <end>
i wish her extremely well   and  no doubt  there are men who might not
object to  every body has their level   but as for myself  i am not 
i think  quite so much at a loss <end>  i need not so totally despair
of an equal alliance  as to be addressing myself to miss smith   
no  madam  my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only 
and the encouragement i received   

 encouragement   i give you encouragement   sir  you have been entirely
mistaken in supposing it <end>  i have seen you only as the admirer
of my friend <end>  in no other light could you have been more to me than
a common acquaintance <end>  i am exceedingly sorry   but it is well that
the mistake ends where it does <end>  had the same behaviour continued 
miss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views 
not being aware  probably  any more than myself  of the very
great inequality which you are so sensible of <end>  but  as it is 
the disappointment is single  and  i trust  will not be lasting <end>
i have no thoughts of matrimony at present <end> 

he was too angry to say another word  her manner too decided
to invite supplication  and in this state of swelling resentment 
and mutually deep mortification  they had to continue together a few
minutes longer  for the fears of mr <end> woodhouse had confined them
to a foot pace <end> if there had not been so much anger  there would have
been desperate awkwardness  but their straightforward emotions left
no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment <end>  without knowing
when the carriage turned into vicarage lane  or when it stopped 
they found themselves  all at once  at the door of his house 
and he was out before another syllable passed <end>  emma then felt it
indispensable to wish him a good night <end>  the compliment was just returned 
coldly and proudly  and  under indescribable irritation of spirits 
she was then conveyed to hartfield <end>

there she was welcomed  with the utmost delight  by her father 
who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from
vicarage lane  turning a corner which he could never bear to think of  
and in strange hands  a mere common coachman  no james  and there it
seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well 
for mr <end> john knightley  ashamed of his ill humour  was now all
kindness and attention  and so particularly solicitous for the comfort
of her father  as to seem  if not quite ready to join him in a basin
of gruel  perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome 
and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party 
except herself <end>  but her mind had never been in such perturbation 
and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till
the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection <end>



chapter xvi


the hair was curled  and the maid sent away  and emma sat down to think
and be miserable <end>  it was a wretched business indeed   such an overthrow
of every thing she had been wishing for   such a development of every
thing most unwelcome   such a blow for harriet   that was the worst
of all <end>  every part of it brought pain and humiliation  of some sort
or other  but  compared with the evil to harriet  all was light 
and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken  
more in error  more disgraced by mis judgment  than she actually was 
could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself <end>

 if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man  i could have
borne any thing <end>  he might have doubled his presumption to me  
but poor harriet  

how she could have been so deceived   he protested that he
had never thought seriously of harriet  never   she looked back
as well as she could  but it was all confusion <end>  she had taken
up the idea  she supposed  and made every thing bend to it <end>
his manners  however  must have been unmarked  wavering  dubious 
or she could not have been so misled <end>

the picture   how eager he had been about the picture   
and the charade   and an hundred other circumstances   
how clearly they had seemed to point at harriet <end>  to be sure 
the charade  with its  ready wit   but then the  soft eyes   
in fact it suited neither  it was a jumble without taste or truth <end>
who could have seen through such thick headed nonsense 

certainly she had often  especially of late  thought his manners
to herself unnecessarily gallant  but it had passed as his way 
as a mere error of judgment  of knowledge  of taste  as one proof
among others that he had not always lived in the best society 
that with all the gentleness of his address  true elegance
was sometimes wanting  but  till this very day  she had never 
for an instant  suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect
to her as harriet s friend <end>

to mr <end> john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on
the subject  for the first start of its possibility <end>  there was
no denying that those brothers had penetration <end>  she remembered
what mr <end> knightley had once said to her about mr <end> elton  the caution
he had given  the conviction he had professed that mr <end> elton would
never marry indiscreetly  and blushed to think how much truer
a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she
had reached herself <end>  it was dreadfully mortifying  but mr <end> elton
was proving himself  in many respects  the very reverse of what she
had meant and believed him  proud  assuming  conceited  very full
of his own claims  and little concerned about the feelings of others <end>

contrary to the usual course of things  mr <end> elton s wanting
to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion <end>
his professions and his proposals did him no service <end>  she thought
nothing of his attachment  and was insulted by his hopes <end>
he wanted to marry well  and having the arrogance to raise his
eyes to her  pretended to be in love  but she was perfectly easy
as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for <end>
there had been no real affection either in his language or manners <end>
sighs and fine words had been given in abundance  but she could
hardly devise any set of expressions  or fancy any tone of voice 
less allied with real love <end>  she need not trouble herself to pity him <end>
he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself  and if miss woodhouse
of hartfield  the heiress of thirty thousand pounds  were not quite
so easily obtained as he had fancied  he would soon try for miss
somebody else with twenty  or with ten <end>

but  that he should talk of encouragement  should consider her as
aware of his views  accepting his attentions  meaning  in short  
to marry him   should suppose himself her equal in connexion
or mind   look down upon her friend  so well understanding the
gradations of rank below him  and be so blind to what rose above 
as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her   
it was most provoking <end>

perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he
was her inferior in talent  and all the elegancies of mind <end>
the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it 
but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly
his superior <end>  he must know that the woodhouses had been settled
for several generations at hartfield  the younger branch
of a very ancient family  and that the eltons were nobody <end>
the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable 
being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate  to which all
the rest of highbury belonged  but their fortune  from other sources 
was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself 
in every other kind of consequence  and the woodhouses had long
held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which
mr <end> elton had first entered not two years ago  to make his way
as he could  without any alliances but in trade  or any thing
to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility <end>  
but he had fancied her in love with him  that evidently must
have been his dependence  and after raving a little about the
seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head 
emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own
behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging  so full of
courtesy and attention  as  supposing her real motive unperceived 
might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy 
like mr <end> elton  in fancying himself a very decided favourite <end>  if  she 
had so misinterpreted his feelings  she had little right to wonder
that  he   with self interest to blind him  should have mistaken hers <end>

the first error and the worst lay at her door <end>  it was foolish 
it was wrong  to take so active a part in bringing any two
people together <end>  it was adventuring too far  assuming too much 
making light of what ought to be serious  a trick of what ought
to be simple <end>  she was quite concerned and ashamed  and resolved
to do such things no more <end>

 here have i   said she   actually talked poor harriet into being
very much attached to this man <end>  she might never have thought of him
but for me  and certainly never would have thought of him with hope 
if i had not assured her of his attachment  for she is as modest
and humble as i used to think him <end>  oh  that i had been satisfied with
persuading her not to accept young martin <end>  there i was quite right <end>
that was well done of me  but there i should have stopped  and left
the rest to time and chance <end>  i was introducing her into good company 
and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having 
i ought not to have attempted more <end>  but now  poor girl  her peace
is cut up for some time <end>  i have been but half a friend to her 
and if she were  not  to feel this disappointment so very much  i am
sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable
for her   william coxe  oh  no  i could not endure william coxe  
a pert young lawyer <end> 

she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse  and then resumed
a more serious  more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been 
and might be  and must be <end>  the distressing explanation she had
to make to harriet  and all that poor harriet would be suffering 
with the awkwardness of future meetings  the difficulties of
continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance  of subduing feelings 
concealing resentment  and avoiding eclat  were enough to occupy
her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer  and she went
to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having
blundered most dreadfully <end>

to youth and natural cheerfulness like emma s  though under
temporary gloom at night  the return of day will hardly fail
to bring return of spirits <end>  the youth and cheerfulness of morning
are in happy analogy  and of powerful operation  and if the
distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed  they
will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope <end>

emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had
gone to bed  more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her 
and to depend on getting tolerably out of it <end>

it was a great consolation that mr <end> elton should not be really
in love with her  or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking
to disappoint him  that harriet s nature should not be of that
superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive  
and that there could be no necessity for any body s knowing
what had passed except the three principals  and especially
for her father s being given a moment s uneasiness about it <end>

these were very cheering thoughts  and the sight of a great deal
of snow on the ground did her further service  for any thing was
welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder
at present <end>

the weather was most favourable for her  though christmas day 
she could not go to church <end>  mr <end> woodhouse would have been miserable
had his daughter attempted it  and she was therefore safe from
either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas <end>
the ground covered with snow  and the atmosphere in that unsettled
state between frost and thaw  which is of all others the most
unfriendly for exercise  every morning beginning in rain or snow 
and every evening setting in to freeze  she was for many days a most
honourable prisoner <end>  no intercourse with harriet possible but by note 
no church for her on sunday any more than on christmas day  and no
need to find excuses for mr <end> elton s absenting himself <end>

it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home 
and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort
in some society or other  it was very pleasant to have her father
so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house 
too wise to stir out  and to hear him say to mr <end> knightley  whom no
weather could keep entirely from them   

 ah   mr <end> knightley  why do not you stay at home like poor mr <end> elton  

these days of confinement would have been  but for her private
perplexities  remarkably comfortable  as such seclusion exactly
suited her brother  whose feelings must always be of great importance
to his companions  and he had  besides  so thoroughly cleared off
his ill humour at randalls  that his amiableness never failed him
during the rest of his stay at hartfield <end>  he was always agreeable
and obliging  and speaking pleasantly of every body <end>  but with all
the hopes of cheerfulness  and all the present comfort of delay 
there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation
with harriet  as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease <end>



chapter xvii


mr <end> and mrs <end> john knightley were not detained long at hartfield <end>
the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move 
and mr <end> woodhouse having  as usual  tried to persuade his daughter
to stay behind with all her children  was obliged to see the whole
party set off  and return to his lamentations over the destiny
of poor isabella   which poor isabella  passing her life with
those she doated on  full of their merits  blind to their faults 
and always innocently busy  might have been a model of right
feminine happiness <end>

the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note
from mr <end> elton to mr <end> woodhouse  a long  civil  ceremonious note 
to say  with mr <end> elton s best compliments   that he was proposing
to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath 
where  in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends 
he had engaged to spend a few weeks  and very much regretted
the impossibility he was under  from various circumstances of
weather and business  of taking a personal leave of mr <end> woodhouse 
of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense  
and had mr <end> woodhouse any commands  should be happy to attend to them <end> 

emma was most agreeably surprized <end>  mr <end> elton s absence just
at this time was the very thing to be desired <end>  she admired
him for contriving it  though not able to give him much credit
for the manner in which it was announced <end>  resentment could not
have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father 
from which she was so pointedly excluded <end>  she had not even a
share in his opening compliments <end>  her name was not mentioned   
and there was so striking a change in all this  and such an
ill judged solemnity of leave taking in his graceful acknowledgments 
as she thought  at first  could not escape her father s suspicion <end>

it did  however <end>  her father was quite taken up with the surprize
of so sudden a journey  and his fears that mr <end> elton might never get
safely to the end of it  and saw nothing extraordinary in his language <end>
it was a very useful note  for it supplied them with fresh matter
for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening <end>
mr <end> woodhouse talked over his alarms  and emma was in spirits
to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude <end>

she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark <end>  she had
reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold  and it was
desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting
the better of her other complaint before the gentleman s return <end>
she went to mrs <end> goddard s accordingly the very next day  to undergo
the necessary penance of communication  and a severe one it was <end>  
she had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously
feeding  to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred  
and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis judging in all her
ideas on one subject  all her observations  all her convictions 
all her prophecies for the last six weeks <end>

the confession completely renewed her first shame  and the sight
of harriet s tears made her think that she should never be in charity
with herself again <end>

harriet bore the intelligence very well  blaming nobody  
and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition
and lowly opinion of herself  as must appear with particular
advantage at that moment to her friend <end>

emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost 
and all that was amiable  all that ought to be attaching 
seemed on harriet s side  not her own <end>  harriet did not consider
herself as having any thing to complain of <end>  the affection of such
a man as mr <end> elton would have been too great a distinction <end>  
she never could have deserved him  and nobody but so partial
and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible <end>

her tears fell abundantly  but her grief was so truly artless 
that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emma s eyes  
and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart
and understanding  really for the time convinced that harriet was
the superior creature of the two  and that to resemble her would
be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or
intelligence could do <end>

it was rather too late in the day to set about being simple minded
and ignorant  but she left her with every previous resolution
confirmed of being humble and discreet  and repressing imagination
all the rest of her life <end>  her second duty now  inferior only to her
father s claims  was to promote harriet s comfort  and endeavour
to prove her own affection in some better method than by match making <end>
she got her to hartfield  and shewed her the most unvarying kindness 
striving to occupy and amuse her  and by books and conversation 
to drive mr <end> elton from her thoughts <end>

time  she knew  must be allowed for this being thoroughly done  and she
could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general 
and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr <end> elton
in particular  but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriet s age 
and with the entire extinction of all hope  such a progress might be
made towards a state of composure by the time of mr <end> elton s return 
as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance 
without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them <end>

harriet did think him all perfection  and maintained the non existence
of any body equal to him in person or goodness  and did  in truth 
prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen 
but yet it appeared to her so natural  so inevitable to strive
against an inclination of that sort  unrequited   that she could not
comprehend its continuing very long in equal force <end>

if mr <end> elton  on his return  made his own indifference as evident
and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do 
she could not imagine harriet s persisting to place her happiness
in the sight or the recollection of him <end>

their being fixed  so absolutely fixed  in the same place  was bad
for each  for all three <end>  not one of them had the power of removal 
or of effecting any material change of society <end>  they must encounter
each other  and make the best of it <end>

harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at
mrs <end> goddard s  mr <end> elton being the adoration of all the teachers
and great girls in the school  and it must be at hartfield only
that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling
moderation or repellent truth <end>  where the wound had been given 
there must the cure be found if anywhere  and emma felt that 
till she saw her in the way of cure  there could be no true peace
for herself <end>



chapter xviii


mr <end> frank churchill did not come <end>  when the time proposed
drew near  mrs <end> weston s fears were justified in the arrival
of a letter of excuse <end>  for the present  he could not be spared 
to his  very great mortification and regret  but still he looked
forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period <end> 

mrs <end> weston was exceedingly disappointed  much more disappointed 
in fact  than her husband  though her dependence on seeing the
young man had been so much more sober   but a sanguine temper 
though for ever expecting more good than occurs  does not
always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression <end>
it soon flies over the present failure  and begins to hope again <end>
for half an hour mr <end> weston was surprized and sorry  but then he
began to perceive that frank s coming two or three months later
would be a much better plan  better time of year  better weather 
and that he would be able  without any doubt  to stay considerably
longer with them than if he had come sooner <end>

these feelings rapidly restored his comfort  while mrs <end> weston 
of a more apprehensive disposition  foresaw nothing but a repetition
of excuses and delays  and after all her concern for what her husband
was to suffer  suffered a great deal more herself <end>

emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really
about mr <end> frank churchill s not coming  except as a disappointment
at randalls <end>  the acquaintance at present had no charm for her <end>
she wanted  rather  to be quiet  and out of temptation  but still  as it
was desirable that she should appear  in general  like her usual self 
she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance 
and enter as warmly into mr <end> and mrs <end> weston s disappointment 
as might naturally belong to their friendship <end>

she was the first to announce it to mr <end> knightley  and exclaimed
quite as much as was necessary   or  being acting a part  perhaps
rather more   at the conduct of the churchills  in keeping him away <end>
she then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt  of the
advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry 
the pleasure of looking at somebody new  the gala day to highbury entire 
which the sight of him would have made  and ending with reflections
on the churchills again  found herself directly involved in a
disagreement with mr <end> knightley  and  to her great amusement 
perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her
real opinion  and making use of mrs <end> weston s arguments against herself <end>

 the churchills are very likely in fault   said mr <end> knightley 
coolly   but i dare say he might come if he would <end> 

 i do not know why you should say so <end>  he wishes exceedingly to come 
but his uncle and aunt will not spare him <end> 

 i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming  if he made
a point of it <end>  it is too unlikely  for me to believe it without proof <end> 

 how odd you are   what has mr <end> frank churchill done  to make you
suppose him such an unnatural creature  

 i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature  in suspecting
that he may have learnt to be above his connexions  and to care
very little for any thing but his own pleasure  from living with
those who have always set him the example of it <end>  it is a great deal
more natural than one could wish  that a young man  brought up
by those who are proud  luxurious  and selfish  should be proud 
luxurious  and selfish too <end>  if frank churchill had wanted to see
his father  he would have contrived it between september and january <end>
a man at his age  what is he   three or four and twenty  cannot be
without the means of doing as much as that <end>  it is impossible <end> 

 that s easily said  and easily felt by you  who have always
been your own master <end>  you are the worst judge in the world 
mr <end> knightley  of the difficulties of dependence <end>  you do not know
what it is to have tempers to manage <end> 

 it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four and twenty
should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount <end>  he cannot
want money  he cannot want leisure <end>  we know  on the contrary 
that he has so much of both  that he is glad to get rid of them at
the idlest haunts in the kingdom <end>  we hear of him for ever at some
watering place or other <end>  a little while ago  he was at weymouth <end>
this proves that he can leave the churchills <end> 

 yes  sometimes he can <end> 

 and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while 
whenever there is any temptation of pleasure <end> 

 it is very unfair to judge of any body s conduct  without an
intimate knowledge of their situation <end>  nobody  who has not been
in the interior of a family  can say what the difficulties
of any individual of that family may be <end>  we ought to be
acquainted with enscombe  and with mrs <end> churchill s temper 
before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do <end>
he may  at times  be able to do a great deal more than he can at others <end> 

 there is one thing  emma  which a man can always do  if he chuses 
and that is  his duty  not by manoeuvring and finessing  but by vigour
and resolution <end>  it is frank churchill s duty to pay this attention
to his father <end>  he knows it to be so  by his promises and messages 
but if he wished to do it  it might be done <end>  a man who felt rightly
would say at once  simply and resolutely  to mrs <end> churchill  
 every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make
to your convenience  but i must go and see my father immediately <end>
i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him
on the present occasion <end>  i shall  therefore  set off to morrow <end>   
if he would say so to her at once  in the tone of decision becoming
a man  there would be no opposition made to his going <end> 

 no   said emma  laughing   but perhaps there might be some made to his
coming back again <end>  such language for a young man entirely dependent 
to use   nobody but you  mr <end> knightley  would imagine it possible <end>
but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly
opposite to your own <end>  mr <end> frank churchill to be making such
a speech as that to the uncle and aunt  who have brought him up 
and are to provide for him   standing up in the middle of the room 
i suppose  and speaking as loud as he could   how can you imagine
such conduct practicable  

 depend upon it  emma  a sensible man would find no difficulty in it <end>
he would feel himself in the right  and the declaration  made 
of course  as a man of sense would make it  in a proper manner  
would do him more good  raise him higher  fix his interest stronger
with the people he depended on  than all that a line of shifts
and expedients can ever do <end>  respect would be added to affection <end>
they would feel that they could trust him  that the nephew who had
done rightly by his father  would do rightly by them  for they know 
as well as he does  as well as all the world must know  that he
ought to pay this visit to his father  and while meanly exerting
their power to delay it  are in their hearts not thinking the better
of him for submitting to their whims <end>  respect for right conduct
is felt by every body <end>  if he would act in this sort of manner 
on principle  consistently  regularly  their little minds would bend
to his <end> 

 i rather doubt that <end>  you are very fond of bending little minds 
but where little minds belong to rich people in authority 
i think they have a knack of swelling out  till they are quite as
unmanageable as great ones <end>  i can imagine  that if you  as you are 
mr <end> knightley  were to be transported and placed all at once in
mr <end> frank churchill s situation  you would be able to say and do
just what you have been recommending for him  and it might have
a very good effect <end>  the churchills might not have a word to say
in return  but then  you would have no habits of early obedience
and long observance to break through <end>  to him who has  it might
not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence 
and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought <end>
he may have as strong a sense of what would be right  as you can have 
without being so equal  under particular circumstances  to act up
to it <end> 

 then it would not be so strong a sense <end>  if it failed to produce
equal exertion  it could not be an equal conviction <end> 

 oh  the difference of situation and habit   i wish you would try
to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel
in directly opposing those  whom as child and boy he has been
looking up to all his life <end> 

 our amiable young man is a very weak young man  if this be the first
occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against
the will of others <end>  it ought to have been a habit with him by
this time  of following his duty  instead of consulting expediency <end>
i can allow for the fears of the child  but not of the man <end>
as he became rational  he ought to have roused himself and shaken off
all that was unworthy in their authority <end>  he ought to have opposed
the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father <end>
had he begun as he ought  there would have been no difficulty now <end> 

 we shall never agree about him   cried emma   but that is
nothing extraordinary <end>  i have not the least idea of his being
a weak young man   i feel sure that he is not <end>  mr <end> weston would
not be blind to folly  though in his own son  but he is very likely
to have a more yielding  complying  mild disposition than would suit
your notions of man s perfection <end>  i dare say he has  and though
it may cut him off from some advantages  it will secure him many others <end> 

 yes  all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move 
and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure  and fancying himself
extremely expert in finding excuses for it <end>  he can sit down and
write a fine flourishing letter  full of professions and falsehoods 
and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method
in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father s
having any right to complain <end>  his letters disgust me <end> 

 your feelings are singular <end>  they seem to satisfy every body else <end> 

 i suspect they do not satisfy mrs <end> weston <end>  they hardly can
satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings   standing in
a mother s place  but without a mother s affection to blind her <end>
it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due 
and she must doubly feel the omission <end>  had she been a person
of consequence herself  he would have come i dare say  and it would
not have signified whether he did or no <end>  can you think your friend
behindhand in these sort of considerations   do you suppose she
does not often say all this to herself   no  emma  your amiable
young man can be amiable only in french  not in english <end>  he may be
very  aimable   have very good manners  and be very agreeable  but he
can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people 
nothing really amiable about him <end> 

 you seem determined to think ill of him <end> 

 me   not at all   replied mr <end> knightley  rather displeased   i do
not want to think ill of him <end>  i should be as ready to acknowledge
his merits as any other man  but i hear of none  except what are
merely personal  that he is well grown and good looking  with smooth 
plausible manners <end> 

 well  if he have nothing else to recommend him  he will be a
treasure at highbury <end>  we do not often look upon fine young men 
well bred and agreeable <end>  we must not be nice and ask for all
the virtues into the bargain <end>  cannot you imagine  mr <end> knightley 
what a  sensation  his coming will produce   there will be but one subject
throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury  but one interest  
one object of curiosity  it will be all mr <end> frank churchill 
we shall think and speak of nobody else <end> 

 you will excuse my being so much over powered <end> if i find him
conversable  i shall be glad of his acquaintance  but if he is only
a chattering coxcomb  he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts <end> 

 my idea of him is  that he can adapt his conversation to the taste
of every body  and has the power as well as the wish of being
universally agreeable <end>  to you  he will talk of farming  to me 
of drawing or music  and so on to every body  having that general
information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead 
or take the lead  just as propriety may require  and to speak
extremely well on each  that is my idea of him <end> 

 and mine   said mr <end> knightley warmly   is  that if he turn out any
thing like it  he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing 
what  at three and twenty to be the king of his company  the great man  
the practised politician  who is to read every body s character 
and make every body s talents conduce to the display of his
own superiority  to be dispensing his flatteries around  that he
may make all appear like fools compared with himself   my dear emma 
your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came
to the point <end> 

 i will say no more about him   cried emma   you turn every
thing to evil <end>  we are both prejudiced  you against  i for him 
and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here <end> 

 prejudiced   i am not prejudiced <end> 

 but i am very much  and without being at all ashamed of it <end>
my love for mr <end> and mrs <end> weston gives me a decided prejudice in
his favour <end> 

 he is a person i never think of from one month s end to another  
said mr <end> knightley  with a degree of vexation  which made emma
immediately talk of something else  though she could not comprehend
why he should be angry <end>

to take a dislike to a young man  only because he appeared to be
of a different disposition from himself  was unworthy the real
liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him 
for with all the high opinion of himself  which she had often laid
to his charge  she had never before for a moment supposed it could
make him unjust to the merit of another <end>




volume ii



chapter i


emma and harriet had been walking together one morning  and 
in emma s opinion  had been talking enough of mr <end> elton for that day <end>
she could not think that harriet s solace or her own sins required more 
and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject
as they returned   but it burst out again when she thought she
had succeeded  and after speaking some time of what the poor must
suffer in winter  and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive  
 mr <end> elton is so good to the poor   she found something else must be done <end>

they were just approaching the house where lived mrs <end> and miss bates <end>
she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers <end>
there was always sufficient reason for such an attention  mrs <end> and
miss bates loved to be called on  and she knew she was considered
by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her 
as rather negligent in that respect  and as not contributing what she
ought to the stock of their scanty comforts <end>

she had had many a hint from mr <end> knightley and some from her own heart 
as to her deficiency  but none were equal to counteract the persuasion
of its being very disagreeable   a waste of time  tiresome women  
and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second rate
and third rate of highbury  who were calling on them for ever 
and therefore she seldom went near them <end>  but now she made the sudden
resolution of not passing their door without going in  observing 
as she proposed it to harriet  that  as well as she could calculate 
they were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax <end>

the house belonged to people in business <end>  mrs <end> and miss bates occupied
the drawing room floor  and there  in the very moderate sized apartment 
which was every thing to them  the visitors were most cordially
and even gratefully welcomed  the quiet neat old lady  who with her
knitting was seated in the warmest corner  wanting even to give up
her place to miss woodhouse  and her more active  talking daughter 
almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness  thanks for
their visit  solicitude for their shoes  anxious inquiries after
mr <end> woodhouse s health  cheerful communications about her mother s 
and sweet cake from the beaufet   mrs <end> cole had just been there 
just called in for ten minutes  and had been so good as to sit an
hour with them  and  she  had taken a piece of cake and been so kind
as to say she liked it very much  and  therefore  she hoped miss
woodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too <end> 

the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr <end> elton <end>
there was intimacy between them  and mr <end> cole had heard from
mr <end> elton since his going away <end>  emma knew what was coming  they must
have the letter over again  and settle how long he had been gone 
and how much he was engaged in company  and what a favourite he
was wherever he went  and how full the master of the ceremonies 
ball had been  and she went through it very well  with all the
interest and all the commendation that could be requisite  and always
putting forward to prevent harriet s being obliged to say a word <end>

this she had been prepared for when she entered the house 
but meant  having once talked him handsomely over  to be no farther
incommoded by any troublesome topic  and to wander at large amongst
all the mistresses and misses of highbury  and their card parties <end>
she had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr <end> elton 
but he was actually hurried off by miss bates  she jumped away
from him at last abruptly to the coles  to usher in a letter from
her niece <end>

 oh  yes  mr <end> elton  i understand  certainly as to dancing  
mrs <end> cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was  
mrs <end> cole was so kind as to sit some time with us  talking of jane 
for as soon as she came in  she began inquiring after her 
jane is so very great a favourite there <end>  whenever she is with us 
mrs <end> cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough 
and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can <end>
and so she began inquiring after her directly  saying   i know you
cannot have heard from jane lately  because it is not her time
for writing   and when i immediately said   but indeed we have 
we had a letter this very morning   i do not know that i ever saw
any body more surprized <end>   have you  upon your honour   said she 
 well  that is quite unexpected <end>  do let me hear what she says <end>  

emma s politeness was at hand directly  to say  with smiling interest  

 have you heard from miss fairfax so lately   i am extremely happy <end>
i hope she is well  

 thank you <end>  you are so kind   replied the happily deceived aunt 
while eagerly hunting for the letter <end>   oh  here it is <end>  i was sure
it could not be far off  but i had put my huswife upon it  you see 
without being aware  and so it was quite hid  but i had it in my hand
so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table <end>
i was reading it to mrs <end> cole  and since she went away  i was
reading it again to my mother  for it is such a pleasure to her  
a letter from jane  that she can never hear it often enough 
so i knew it could not be far off  and here it is  only just under
my huswife  and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what
she says   but  first of all  i really must  in justice to jane 
apologise for her writing so short a letter  only two pages you see  
hardly two  and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half <end>
my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well <end>
she often says  when the letter is first opened   well  hetty 
now i think you will be put to it to make out all that checker work   
don t you  ma am   and then i tell her  i am sure she would contrive
to make it out herself  if she had nobody to do it for her  
every word of it  i am sure she would pore over it till she had
made out every word <end>  and  indeed  though my mother s eyes are not
so good as they were  she can see amazingly well still  thank god 
with the help of spectacles <end>  it is such a blessing   my mother s
are really very good indeed <end>  jane often says  when she is here 
 i am sure  grandmama  you must have had very strong eyes to see
as you do  and so much fine work as you have done too   i only wish
my eyes may last me as well <end>  

all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath 
and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss
fairfax s handwriting <end>

 you are extremely kind   replied miss bates  highly gratified 
 you who are such a judge  and write so beautifully yourself <end>
i am sure there is nobody s praise that could give us so much pleasure
as miss woodhouse s <end> my mother does not hear  she is a little deaf
you know <end>  ma am   addressing her   do you hear what miss woodhouse
is so obliging to say about jane s handwriting  

and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment
repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it <end>
she was pondering  in the meanwhile  upon the possibility  without seeming
very rude  of making her escape from jane fairfax s letter  and had
almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse 
when miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention <end>

 my mother s deafness is very trifling you see  just nothing at all <end>
by only raising my voice  and saying any thing two or three times over 
she is sure to hear  but then she is used to my voice <end>  but it is very
remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me <end>
jane speaks so distinct   however  she will not find her grandmama
at all deafer than she was two years ago  which is saying a great
deal at my mother s time of life  and it really is full two years 
you know  since she was here <end>  we never were so long without seeing
her before  and as i was telling mrs <end> cole  we shall hardly know
how to make enough of her now <end> 

 are you expecting miss fairfax here soon  

 oh yes  next week <end> 

 indeed   that must be a very great pleasure <end> 

 thank you <end>  you are very kind <end>  yes  next week <end>  every body is
so surprized  and every body says the same obliging things <end>  i am
sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury  as they
can be to see her <end>  yes  friday or saturday  she cannot say which 
because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one
of those days <end>  so very good of them to send her the whole way 
but they always do  you know <end>  oh yes  friday or saturday next <end>
that is what she writes about <end>  that is the reason of her writing out
of rule  as we call it  for  in the common course  we should not have
heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday <end> 

 yes  so i imagined <end>  i was afraid there could be little chance
of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to day <end> 

 so obliging of you   no  we should not have heard  if it had not
been for this particular circumstance  of her being to come here
so soon <end>  my mother is so delighted   for she is to be three months
with us at least <end>  three months  she says so  positively  as i
am going to have the pleasure of reading to you <end>  the case is 
you see  that the campbells are going to ireland <end>  mrs <end> dixon has
persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly <end>
they had not intended to go over till the summer  but she is so
impatient to see them again  for till she married  last october 
she was never away from them so much as a week  which must make
it very strange to be in different kingdoms  i was going to say 
but however different countries  and so she wrote a very urgent letter
to her mother  or her father  i declare i do not know which it was 
but we shall see presently in jane s letter  wrote in mr <end> dixon s
name as well as her own  to press their coming over directly 
and they would give them the meeting in dublin  and take them back
to their country seat  baly craig  a beautiful place  i fancy <end>
jane has heard a great deal of its beauty  from mr <end> dixon  i mean  
i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else 
but it was very natural  you know  that he should like to speak
of his own place while he was paying his addresses  and as jane used
to be very often walking out with them  for colonel and mrs <end> campbell
were very particular about their daughter s not walking out
often with only mr <end> dixon  for which i do not at all blame them 
of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell
about his own home in ireland  and i think she wrote us word
that he had shewn them some drawings of the place  views that he
had taken himself <end>  he is a most amiable  charming young man 
i believe <end>  jane was quite longing to go to ireland  from his account
of things <end> 

at this moment  an ingenious and animating suspicion entering
emma s brain with regard to jane fairfax  this charming mr <end> dixon 
and the not going to ireland  she said  with the insidious design
of farther discovery 

 you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed
to come to you at such a time <end>  considering the very particular
friendship between her and mrs <end> dixon  you could hardly have expected
her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs <end> campbell <end> 

 very true  very true  indeed <end>  the very thing that we have always
been rather afraid of  for we should not have liked to have her
at such a distance from us  for months together  not able to come
if any thing was to happen <end>  but you see  every thing turns out
for the best <end>  they want her  mr <end> and mrs <end> dixon  excessively to
come over with colonel and mrs <end> campbell  quite depend upon it 
nothing can be more kind or pressing than their  joint  invitation 
jane says  as you will hear presently  mr <end> dixon does not seem in the
least backward in any attention <end>  he is a most charming young man <end>
ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth  when they were
out in that party on the water  and she  by the sudden whirling
round of something or other among the sails  would have been dashed
into the sea at once  and actually was all but gone  if he had not 
with the greatest presence of mind  caught hold of her habit  
 i can never think of it without trembling    but ever since we
had the history of that day  i have been so fond of mr <end> dixon  

 but  in spite of all her friends  urgency  and her own wish
of seeing ireland  miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you
and mrs <end> bates  

 yes  entirely her own doing  entirely her own choice  and colonel
and mrs <end> campbell think she does quite right  just what they
should recommend  and indeed they particularly  wish  her to try
her native air  as she has not been quite so well as usual lately <end> 

 i am concerned to hear of it <end>  i think they judge wisely <end>
but mrs <end> dixon must be very much disappointed <end>  mrs <end> dixon 
i understand  has no remarkable degree of personal beauty  is not 
by any means  to be compared with miss fairfax <end> 

 oh  no <end>  you are very obliging to say such things  but certainly not <end>
there is no comparison between them <end>  miss campbell always was
absolutely plain  but extremely elegant and amiable <end> 

 yes  that of course <end> 

 jane caught a bad cold  poor thing  so long ago as the 7th
of november   as i am going to read to you   and has never been
well since <end>  a long time  is not it  for a cold to hang upon her 
she never mentioned it before  because she would not alarm us <end>
just like her  so considerate   but however  she is so far from well 
that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home 
and try an air that always agrees with her  and they have no doubt
that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her  
and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here 
than go to ireland  if she is unwell <end> nobody could nurse her  as we
should do <end> 

 it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world <end> 

 and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday  and the
campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following  
as you will find from jane s letter <end>  so sudden   you may guess 
dear miss woodhouse  what a flurry it has thrown me in 
if it was not for the drawback of her illness  but i am afraid
we must expect to see her grown thin  and looking very poorly <end>
i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me  as to that <end>
i always make a point of reading jane s letters through to myself first 
before i read them aloud to my mother  you know  for fear of there
being any thing in them to distress her <end>  jane desired me to do it 
so i always do   and so i began to day with my usual caution 
but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell  than i
burst out  quite frightened  with  bless me  poor jane is ill    
which my mother  being on the watch  heard distinctly  and was sadly
alarmed at <end>  however  when i read on  i found it was not near so bad
as i had fancied at first  and i make so light of it now to her 
that she does not think much about it <end>  but i cannot imagine
how i could be so off my guard <end>  if jane does not get well soon 
we will call in mr <end> perry <end>  the expense shall not be thought of 
and though he is so liberal  and so fond of jane that i dare say
he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance  we could not
suffer it to be so  you know <end>  he has a wife and family to maintain 
and is not to be giving away his time <end>  well  now i have just given you
a hint of what jane writes about  we will turn to her letter  and i am
sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it
for her <end> 

 i am afraid we must be running away   said emma  glancing at harriet 
and beginning to rise   my father will be expecting us <end>
i had no intention  i thought i had no power of staying more than
five minutes  when i first entered the house <end>  i merely called 
because i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs <end> bates 
but i have been so pleasantly detained   now  however  we must wish
you and mrs <end> bates good morning <end> 

and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded <end>
she regained the street  happy in this  that though much had been
forced on her against her will  though she had in fact heard
the whole substance of jane fairfax s letter  she had been able
to escape the letter itself <end>



chapter ii


jane fairfax was an orphan  the only child of mrs <end> bates s
youngest daughter <end>

the marriage of lieut <end> fairfax of the         regiment of infantry 
and miss jane bates  had had its day of fame and pleasure 
hope and interest  but nothing now remained of it  save the melancholy
remembrance of him dying in action abroad  of his widow sinking
under consumption and grief soon afterwards  and this girl <end>

by birth she belonged to highbury   and when at three years old 
on losing her mother  she became the property  the charge 
the consolation  the fondling of her grandmother and aunt  there had
seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there 
of her being taught only what very limited means could command 
and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement 
to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person 
good understanding  and warm hearted  well meaning relations <end>

but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave
a change to her destiny <end>  this was colonel campbell  who had
very highly regarded fairfax  as an excellent officer and most
deserving young man  and farther  had been indebted to him for
such attentions  during a severe camp fever  as he believed had saved
his life <end>  these were claims which he did not learn to overlook 
though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax 
before his own return to england put any thing in his power <end>
when he did return  he sought out the child and took notice of her <end>
he was a married man  with only one living child  a girl 
about jane s age   and jane became their guest  paying them long visits
and growing a favourite with all  and before she was nine years old 
his daughter s great fondness for her  and his own wish of being
a real friend  united to produce an offer from colonel campbell
of undertaking the whole charge of her education <end>  it was accepted 
and from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbell s family 
and had lived with them entirely  only visiting her grandmother
from time to time <end>

the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others 
the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father
making independence impossible <end>  to provide for her otherwise
was out of colonel campbell s power  for though his income  by pay
and appointments  was handsome  his fortune was moderate and must
be all his daughter s  but  by giving her an education  he hoped
to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter <end>

such was jane fairfax s history <end>  she had fallen into good hands 
known nothing but kindness from the campbells  and been given
an excellent education <end>  living constantly with right minded
and well informed people  her heart and understanding had received
every advantage of discipline and culture  and colonel campbell s
residence being in london  every lighter talent had been done
full justice to  by the attendance of first rate masters <end>
her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that
friendship could do  and at eighteen or nineteen she was  as far
as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children 
fully competent to the office of instruction herself  but she
was too much beloved to be parted with <end>  neither father nor mother
could promote  and the daughter could not endure it <end>  the evil day
was put off <end>  it was easy to decide that she was still too young 
and jane remained with them  sharing  as another daughter  in all
the rational pleasures of an elegant society  and a judicious
mixture of home and amusement  with only the drawback of the future 
the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind
her that all this might soon be over <end>

the affection of the whole family  the warm attachment of miss
campbell in particular  was the more honourable to each party
from the circumstance of jane s decided superiority both in beauty
and acquirements <end>  that nature had given it in feature could not
be unseen by the young woman  nor could her higher powers of mind
be unfelt by the parents <end>  they continued together with unabated
regard however  till the marriage of miss campbell  who by that chance 
that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs 
giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior 
engaged the affections of mr <end> dixon  a young man  rich and agreeable 
almost as soon as they were acquainted  and was eligibly
and happily settled  while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn <end>

this event had very lately taken place  too lately for any thing to be
yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path
of duty  though she had now reached the age which her own judgment
had fixed on for beginning <end>  she had long resolved that one and twenty
should be the period <end>  with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate 
she had resolved at one and twenty to complete the sacrifice 
and retire from all the pleasures of life  of rational intercourse 
equal society  peace and hope  to penance and mortification for ever <end>

the good sense of colonel and mrs <end> campbell could not oppose such
a resolution  though their feelings did <end>  as long as they lived 
no exertions would be necessary  their home might be hers for ever 
and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly 
but this would be selfishness   what must be at last  had better
be soon <end>  perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder
and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay  and spared
her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must
now be relinquished <end>  still  however  affection was glad to catch
at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment <end>
she had never been quite well since the time of their daughter s marriage 
and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength 
they must forbid her engaging in duties  which  so far from being
compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits  seemed 
under the most favourable circumstances  to require something
more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with
tolerable comfort <end>

with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland  her account
to her aunt contained nothing but truth  though there might be some
truths not told <end>  it was her own choice to give the time of their
absence to highbury  to spend  perhaps  her last months of perfect
liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear 
and the campbells  whatever might be their motive or motives 
whether single  or double  or treble  gave the arrangement
their ready sanction  and said  that they depended more on a few
months spent in her native air  for the recovery of her health 
than on any thing else <end>  certain it was that she was to come 
and that highbury  instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which
had been so long promised it  mr <end> frank churchill  must put up for
the present with jane fairfax  who could bring only the freshness
of a two years  absence <end>

emma was sorry   to have to pay civilities to a person she did
not like through three long months   to be always doing more than
she wished  and less than she ought   why she did not like jane
fairfax might be a difficult question to answer  mr <end> knightley
had once told her it was because she saw in her the really
accomplished young woman  which she wanted to be thought herself 
and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time 
there were moments of self examination in which her conscience could
not quite acquit her <end>  but  she could never get acquainted with her 
she did not know how it was  but there was such coldness and reserve  
such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not  and then 
her aunt was such an eternal talker   and she was made such a fuss
with by every body   and it had been always imagined that they were
to be so intimate  because their ages were the same  every body had
supposed they must be so fond of each other <end>   these were her reasons  
she had no better <end>

it was a dislike so little just  every imputed fault was so magnified
by fancy  that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any
considerable absence  without feeling that she had injured her 
and now  when the due visit was paid  on her arrival  after a two years 
interval  she was particularly struck with the very appearance
and manners  which for those two whole years she had been depreciating <end>
jane fairfax was very elegant  remarkably elegant  and she had
herself the highest value for elegance <end>  her height was pretty 
just such as almost every body would think tall  and nobody could
think very tall  her figure particularly graceful  her size a most
becoming medium  between fat and thin  though a slight appearance
of ill health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two <end>
emma could not but feel all this  and then  her face  her features  
there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered 
it was not regular  but it was very pleasing beauty <end>  her eyes 
a deep grey  with dark eye lashes and eyebrows  had never been denied
their praise  but the skin  which she had been used to cavil at 
as wanting colour  had a clearness and delicacy which really needed
no fuller bloom <end>  it was a style of beauty  of which elegance
was the reigning character  and as such  she must  in honour 
by all her principles  admire it   elegance  which  whether of person
or of mind  she saw so little in highbury <end>  there  not to be vulgar 
was distinction  and merit <end>

in short  she sat  during the first visit  looking at jane fairfax
with twofold complacency  the sense of pleasure and the sense
of rendering justice  and was determining that she would dislike
her no longer <end>  when she took in her history  indeed  her situation 
as well as her beauty  when she considered what all this elegance
was destined to  what she was going to sink from  how she was going
to live  it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion
and respect  especially  if to every well known particular entitling
her to interest  were added the highly probable circumstance
of an attachment to mr <end> dixon  which she had so naturally started
to herself <end>  in that case  nothing could be more pitiable
or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on <end>
emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced
mr <end> dixon s actions from his wife  or of any thing mischievous
which her imagination had suggested at first <end>  if it were love 
it might be simple  single  successless love on her side alone <end>
she might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison 
while a sharer of his conversation with her friend  and from the best 
the purest of motives  might now be denying herself this visit
to ireland  and resolving to divide herself effectually from
him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty <end>

upon the whole  emma left her with such softened  charitable feelings 
as made her look around in walking home  and lament that highbury
afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence 
nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her <end>

these were charming feelings  but not lasting <end>  before she had
committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for
jane fairfax  or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices
and errors  than saying to mr <end> knightley   she certainly is handsome 
she is better than handsome    jane had spent an evening at hartfield
with her grandmother and aunt  and every thing was relapsing much
into its usual state <end>  former provocations reappeared <end>  the aunt
was as tiresome as ever  more tiresome  because anxiety for her
health was now added to admiration of her powers  and they had to
listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter
she ate for breakfast  and how small a slice of mutton for dinner 
as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her
mother and herself  and jane s offences rose again <end>  they had music 
emma was obliged to play  and the thanks and praise which necessarily
followed appeared to her an affectation of candour  an air
of greatness  meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very
superior performance <end>  she was  besides  which was the worst of all 
so cold  so cautious   there was no getting at her real opinion <end>
wrapt up in a cloak of politeness  she seemed determined
to hazard nothing <end>  she was disgustingly  was suspiciously reserved <end>

if any thing could be more  where all was most  she was more
reserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing <end>
she seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr <end> dixon s character 
or her own value for his company  or opinion of the suitableness
of the match <end>  it was all general approbation and smoothness 
nothing delineated or distinguished <end>  it did her no service however <end>
her caution was thrown away <end>  emma saw its artifice  and returned
to her first surmises <end>  there probably  was  something more to conceal
than her own preference  mr <end> dixon  perhaps  had been very near
changing one friend for the other  or been fixed only to miss campbell 
for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds <end>

the like reserve prevailed on other topics <end>  she and mr <end> frank churchill
had been at weymouth at the same time <end>  it was known that they were
a little acquainted  but not a syllable of real information could emma
procure as to what he truly was <end>   was he handsome     she believed
he was reckoned a very fine young man <end>    was he agreeable    
 he was generally thought so <end>    did he appear a sensible young man 
a young man of information     at a watering place  or in a common
london acquaintance  it was difficult to decide on such points <end>
manners were all that could be safely judged of  under a much longer
knowledge than they had yet had of mr <end> churchill <end>  she believed
every body found his manners pleasing <end>   emma could not forgive her <end>



chapter iii


emma could not forgive her   but as neither provocation nor resentment
were discerned by mr <end> knightley  who had been of the party  and had
seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side 
he was expressing the next morning  being at hartfield again on
business with mr <end> woodhouse  his approbation of the whole  not so
openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room 
but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma <end>
he had been used to think her unjust to jane  and had now great
pleasure in marking an improvement <end>

 a very pleasant evening   he began  as soon as mr <end> woodhouse
had been talked into what was necessary  told that he understood 
and the papers swept away    particularly pleasant <end>  you and miss
fairfax gave us some very good music <end>  i do not know a more
luxurious state  sir  than sitting at one s ease to be entertained
a whole evening by two such young women  sometimes with music
and sometimes with conversation <end>  i am sure miss fairfax must
have found the evening pleasant  emma <end>  you left nothing undone <end>
i was glad you made her play so much  for having no instrument
at her grandmother s  it must have been a real indulgence <end> 

 i am happy you approved   said emma  smiling   but i hope i am
not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield <end> 

 no  my dear   said her father instantly    that  i am sure you
are not <end>  there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are <end>
if any thing  you are too attentive <end>  the muffin last night  if it
had been handed round once  i think it would have been enough <end> 

 no   said mr <end> knightley  nearly at the same time   you are not
often deficient  not often deficient either in manner or comprehension <end>
i think you understand me  therefore <end> 

an arch look expressed   i understand you well enough   but she
said only   miss fairfax is reserved <end> 

 i always told you she was  a little  but you will soon overcome
all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome  all that
has its foundation in diffidence <end>  what arises from discretion
must be honoured <end> 

 you think her diffident <end>  i do not see it <end> 

 my dear emma   said he  moving from his chair into one close
by her   you are not going to tell me  i hope  that you
had not a pleasant evening <end> 

 oh  no  i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions 
and amused to think how little information i obtained <end> 

 i am disappointed   was his only answer <end>

 i hope every body had a pleasant evening   said mr <end> woodhouse 
in his quiet way <end>   i had <end>  once  i felt the fire rather too much 
but then i moved back my chair a little  a very little  and it did
not disturb me <end>  miss bates was very chatty and good humoured 
as she always is  though she speaks rather too quick <end>  however 
she is very agreeable  and mrs <end> bates too  in a different way <end>
i like old friends  and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of
young lady  a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed <end>
she must have found the evening agreeable  mr <end> knightley  because she
had emma <end> 

 true  sir  and emma  because she had miss fairfax <end> 

emma saw his anxiety  and wishing to appease it  at least for
the present  said  and with a sincerity which no one could question  

 she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one s eyes from <end>
i am always watching her to admire  and i do pity her from my heart <end> 

mr <end> knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared
to express  and before he could make any reply  mr <end> woodhouse 
whose thoughts were on the bates s  said  

 it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined 
a great pity indeed  and i have often wished  but it is so little one
can venture to do  small  trifling presents  of any thing uncommon  
now we have killed a porker  and emma thinks of sending them
a loin or a leg  it is very small and delicate  hartfield pork is
not like any other pork  but still it is pork  and  my dear emma 
unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks  nicely fried 
as ours are fried  without the smallest grease  and not roast it 
for no stomach can bear roast pork  i think we had better send the leg  
do not you think so  my dear  

 my dear papa  i sent the whole hind quarter <end> i knew you would wish it <end>
there will be the leg to be salted  you know  which is so very nice 
and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like <end> 

 that s right  my dear  very right <end>  i had not thought of it before 
but that is the best way <end>  they must not over salt the leg  and then 
if it is not over salted  and if it is very thoroughly boiled 
just as serle boils ours  and eaten very moderately of  with a
boiled turnip  and a little carrot or parsnip  i do not consider
it unwholesome <end> 

 emma   said mr <end> knightley presently   i have a piece of news for you <end>
you like news  and i heard an article in my way hither that i think
will interest you <end> 

 news   oh  yes  i always like news <end>  what is it   why do you
smile so   where did you hear it   at randalls  

he had time only to say 

 no  not at randalls  i have not been near randalls   when the door
was thrown open  and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room <end>
full of thanks  and full of news  miss bates knew not which to
give quickest <end>  mr <end> knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment 
and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him <end>

 oh  my dear sir  how are you this morning   my dear miss woodhouse  
i come quite over powered <end> such a beautiful hind quarter of pork 
you are too bountiful   have you heard the news   mr <end> elton is going
to be married <end> 

emma had not had time even to think of mr <end> elton  and she was
so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start 
and a little blush  at the sound <end>

 there is my news   i thought it would interest you  
said mr <end> knightley  with a smile which implied a conviction
of some part of what had passed between them <end>

 but where could  you  hear it   cried miss bates <end>   where could
you possibly hear it  mr <end> knightley   for it is not five minutes
since i received mrs <end> cole s note  no  it cannot be more than five  
or at least ten  for i had got my bonnet and spencer on  just ready
to come out  i was only gone down to speak to patty again about
the pork  jane was standing in the passage  were not you  jane   
for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting pan
large enough <end>  so i said i would go down and see  and jane said 
 shall i go down instead  for i think you have a little cold 
and patty has been washing the kitchen <end>    oh  my dear  
said i  well  and just then came the note <end>  a miss hawkins  
that s all i know <end>  a miss hawkins of bath <end>  but  mr <end> knightley 
how could you possibly have heard it  for the very moment mr <end> cole
told mrs <end> cole of it  she sat down and wrote to me <end>  a miss hawkins   

 i was with mr <end> cole on business an hour and a half ago <end>
he had just read elton s letter as i was shewn in  and handed it
to me directly <end> 

 well  that is quite  i suppose there never was a piece of news more
generally interesting <end>  my dear sir  you really are too bountiful <end>
my mother desires her very best compliments and regards  and a
thousand thanks  and says you really quite oppress her <end> 

 we consider our hartfield pork   replied mr <end> woodhouse   indeed it
certainly is  so very superior to all other pork  that emma and i
cannot have a greater pleasure than   

 oh  my dear sir  as my mother says  our friends are only too good
to us <end>  if ever there were people who  without having great wealth
themselves  had every thing they could wish for  i am sure it is us <end>
we may well say that  our lot is cast in a goodly heritage <end> 
well  mr <end> knightley  and so you actually saw the letter  well   

 it was short  merely to announce  but cheerful  exulting  of course <end>   
here was a sly glance at emma <end>   he had been so fortunate as to  
i forget the precise words  one has no business to remember them <end>
the information was  as you state  that he was going to be married
to a miss hawkins <end>  by his style  i should imagine it just settled <end> 

 mr <end> elton going to be married   said emma  as soon as she could speak <end>
 he will have every body s wishes for his happiness <end> 

 he is very young to settle   was mr <end> woodhouse s observation <end>
 he had better not be in a hurry <end>  he seemed to me very well off
as he was <end>  we were always glad to see him at hartfield <end> 

 a new neighbour for us all  miss woodhouse   said miss bates 
joyfully   my mother is so pleased   she says she cannot
bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress <end>
this is great news  indeed <end>  jane  you have never seen
mr <end> elton   no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him <end> 

jane s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly
to occupy her <end>

 no  i have never seen mr <end> elton   she replied  starting on this appeal 
 is he  is he a tall man  

 who shall answer that question   cried emma <end>   my father would
say  yes   mr <end> knightley  no   and miss bates and i that he is
just the happy medium <end>  when you have been here a little longer 
miss fairfax  you will understand that mr <end> elton is the standard
of perfection in highbury  both in person and mind <end> 

 very true  miss woodhouse  so she will <end>  he is the very best
young man  but  my dear jane  if you remember  i told you yesterday
he was precisely the height of mr <end> perry <end>  miss hawkins   i dare say 
an excellent young woman <end>  his extreme attention to my mother  
wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew  that she might hear the better 
for my mother is a little deaf  you know  it is not much  but she
does not hear quite quick <end>  jane says that colonel campbell is a
little deaf <end>  he fancied bathing might be good for it  the warm bath  
but she says it did him no lasting benefit <end>  colonel campbell 
you know  is quite our angel <end>  and mr <end> dixon seems a very charming
young man  quite worthy of him <end>  it is such a happiness when good
people get together  and they always do <end>  now  here will be mr <end> elton
and miss hawkins  and there are the coles  such very good people 
and the perrys  i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple
than mr <end> and mrs <end> perry <end>  i say  sir   turning to mr <end> woodhouse 
 i think there are few places with such society as highbury <end>
i always say  we are quite blessed in our neighbours <end>  my dear sir 
if there is one thing my mother loves better than another  it is pork  
a roast loin of pork   

 as to who  or what miss hawkins is  or how long he has been
acquainted with her   said emma   nothing i suppose can be known <end>
one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance <end>  he has been
gone only four weeks <end> 

nobody had any information to give  and  after a few more wonderings 
emma said 

 you are silent  miss fairfax  but i hope you mean to take
an interest in this news <end>  you  who have been hearing and seeing
so much of late on these subjects  who must have been so deep
in the business on miss campbell s account  we shall not excuse
your being indifferent about mr <end> elton and miss hawkins <end> 

 when i have seen mr <end> elton   replied jane   i dare say i
shall be interested  but i believe it requires  that  with me <end>
and as it is some months since miss campbell married  the impression
may be a little worn off <end> 

 yes  he has been gone just four weeks  as you observe  miss woodhouse  
said miss bates   four weeks yesterday <end>  a miss hawkins   well  i had
always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts 
not that i ever  mrs <end> cole once whispered to me  but i immediately said 
 no  mr <end> elton is a most worthy young man  but   in short  i do
not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries <end>
i do not pretend to it <end>  what is before me  i see <end>  at the same time 
nobody could wonder if mr <end> elton should have aspired  miss woodhouse
lets me chatter on  so good humouredly <end> she knows i would not
offend for the world <end>  how does miss smith do   she seems quite
recovered now <end>  have you heard from mrs <end> john knightley lately 
oh  those dear little children <end>  jane  do you know i always fancy
mr <end> dixon like mr <end> john knightley <end>  i mean in person  tall  and with
that sort of look  and not very talkative <end> 

 quite wrong  my dear aunt  there is no likeness at all <end> 

 very odd  but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand <end>
one takes up a notion  and runs away with it <end>  mr <end> dixon  you say 
is not  strictly speaking  handsome  

 handsome   oh  no  far from it  certainly plain <end>  i told you he
was plain <end> 

 my dear  you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain 
and that you yourself   

 oh  as for me  my judgment is worth nothing <end>  where i have a regard 
i always think a person well looking <end> but i gave what i believed
the general opinion  when i called him plain <end> 

 well  my dear jane  i believe we must be running away <end>
the weather does not look well  and grandmama will be uneasy <end>
you are too obliging  my dear miss woodhouse  but we really must
take leave <end>  this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed <end>
i shall just go round by mrs <end> cole s  but i shall not stop three minutes 
and  jane  you had better go home directly  i would not have you
out in a shower   we think she is the better for highbury already <end>
thank you  we do indeed <end>  i shall not attempt calling on mrs <end> goddard 
for i really do not think she cares for any thing but  boiled  pork 
when we dress the leg it will be another thing <end>  good morning to you 
my dear sir <end>  oh   mr <end> knightley is coming too <end>  well  that is
so very   i am sure if jane is tired  you will be so kind as to
give her your arm <end>  mr <end> elton  and miss hawkins   good morning
to you <end> 

emma  alone with her father  had half her attention wanted by him
while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry  
and to marry strangers too  and the other half she could give
to her own view of the subject <end>  it was to herself an amusing
and a very welcome piece of news  as proving that mr <end> elton
could not have suffered long  but she was sorry for harriet 
harriet must feel it  and all that she could hope was  by giving
the first information herself  to save her from hearing it abruptly
from others <end>  it was now about the time that she was likely to call <end>
if she were to meet miss bates in her way   and upon its beginning
to rain  emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be
detaining her at mrs <end> goddard s  and that the intelligence would
undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation <end>

the shower was heavy  but short  and it had not been over five minutes 
when in came harriet  with just the heated  agitated look which
hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give  and the
 oh  miss woodhouse  what do you think has happened   which instantly
burst forth  had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation <end>
as the blow was given  emma felt that she could not now shew greater
kindness than in listening  and harriet  unchecked  ran eagerly
through what she had to tell <end>   she had set out from mrs <end> goddard s
half an hour ago  she had been afraid it would rain  she had been
afraid it would pour down every moment  but she thought she might
get to hartfield first  she had hurried on as fast as possible 
but then  as she was passing by the house where a young woman
was making up a gown for her  she thought she would just step
in and see how it went on  and though she did not seem to stay
half a moment there  soon after she came out it began to rain 
and she did not know what to do  so she ran on directly  as fast
as she could  and took shelter at ford s <end>   ford s was the principal
woollen draper  linen draper  and haberdasher s shop united 
the shop first in size and fashion in the place <end>   and so 
there she had set  without an idea of any thing in the world 
full ten minutes  perhaps  when  all of a sudden  who should come in  
to be sure it was so very odd   but they always dealt at ford s  
who should come in  but elizabeth martin and her brother   
dear miss woodhouse  only think <end>  i thought i should have fainted <end>
i did not know what to do <end>  i was sitting near the door  elizabeth saw
me directly  but he did not  he was busy with the umbrella <end>
i am sure she saw me  but she looked away directly  and took
no notice  and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop 
and i kept sitting near the door   oh  dear  i was so miserable 
i am sure i must have been as white as my gown <end>  i could not go away
you know  because of the rain  but i did so wish myself anywhere
in the world but there <end>  oh  dear  miss woodhouse  well  at last 
i fancy  he looked round and saw me  for instead of going
on with her buyings  they began whispering to one another <end>
i am sure they were talking of me  and i could not help thinking
that he was persuading her to speak to me   do you think he was 
miss woodhouse    for presently she came forward  came quite up
to me  and asked me how i did  and seemed ready to shake hands 
if i would <end>  she did not do any of it in the same way that she used 
i could see she was altered  but  however  she seemed to  try  to be
very friendly  and we shook hands  and stood talking some time 
but i know no more what i said  i was in such a tremble   i remember
she said she was sorry we never met now  which i thought almost
too kind   dear  miss woodhouse  i was absolutely miserable 
by that time  it was beginning to hold up  and i was determined
that nothing should stop me from getting away  and then  only think   
i found he was coming up towards me too  slowly you know  and as
if he did not quite know what to do  and so he came and spoke 
and i answered  and i stood for a minute  feeling dreadfully 
you know  one can t tell how  and then i took courage  and said it
did not rain  and i must go  and so off i set  and i had not got
three yards from the door  when he came after me  only to say 
if i was going to hartfield  he thought i had much better go round
by mr <end> cole s stables  for i should find the near way quite floated
by this rain <end>  oh  dear  i thought it would have been the death of me 
so i said  i was very much obliged to him   you know i could
not do less  and then he went back to elizabeth  and i came round
by the stables  i believe i did  but i hardly knew where i was 
or any thing about it <end>  oh   miss woodhouse  i would rather done
any thing than have it happen   and yet  you know  there was a sort
of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly <end>
and elizabeth  too <end>  oh   miss woodhouse  do talk to me and make
me comfortable again <end> 

very sincerely did emma wish to do so  but it was not immediately in
her power <end>  she was obliged to stop and think <end>  she was not thoroughly
comfortable herself <end>  the young man s conduct  and his sister s 
seemed the result of real feeling  and she could not but pity them <end>
as harriet described it  there had been an interesting mixture
of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour <end>
but she had believed them to be well meaning  worthy people before 
and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion 
it was folly to be disturbed by it <end>  of course  he must be sorry
to lose her  they must be all sorry <end>  ambition  as well as love 
had probably been mortified <end>  they might all have hoped to rise
by harriet s acquaintance   and besides  what was the value of
harriet s description   so easily pleased  so little discerning   
what signified her praise 

she exerted herself  and did try to make her comfortable 
by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle  and quite
unworthy of being dwelt on 

 it might be distressing  for the moment   said she   but you seem
to have behaved extremely well  and it is over  and may never  
can never  as a first meeting  occur again  and therefore you need
not think about it <end> 

harriet said   very true   and she  would not think about it  
but still she talked of it  still she could talk of nothing else 
and emma  at last  in order to put the martins out of her head 
was obliged to hurry on the news  which she had meant to give
with so much tender caution  hardly knowing herself whether
to rejoice or be angry  ashamed or only amused  at such a state
of mind in poor harriet  such a conclusion of mr <end> elton s importance
with her 

mr <end> elton s rights  however  gradually revived <end>  though she did not
feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before 
or an hour before  its interest soon increased  and before their
first conversation was over  she had talked herself into all the
sensations of curiosity  wonder and regret  pain and pleasure 
as to this fortunate miss hawkins  which could conduce to place
the martins under proper subordination in her fancy <end>

emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting <end>
it had been serviceable in deadening the first shock  without retaining
any influence to alarm <end>  as harriet now lived  the martins could
not get at her  without seeking her  where hitherto they had wanted
either the courage or the condescension to seek her  for since her
refusal of the brother  the sisters never had been at mrs <end> goddard s 
and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again 
with any necessity  or even any power of speech <end>



chapter iv


human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in
interesting situations  that a young person  who either marries
or dies  is sure of being kindly spoken of <end>

a week had not passed since miss hawkins s name was first
mentioned in highbury  before she was  by some means or other 
discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind 
to be handsome  elegant  highly accomplished  and perfectly amiable 
and when mr <end> elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects 
and circulate the fame of her merits  there was very little more
for him to do  than to tell her christian name  and say whose
music she principally played <end>

mr <end> elton returned  a very happy man <end>  he had gone away rejected
and mortified  disappointed in a very sanguine hope  after a series
of what appeared to him strong encouragement  and not only losing
the right lady  but finding himself debased to the level of a very
wrong one <end>  he had gone away deeply offended  he came back engaged
to another  and to another as superior  of course  to the first 
as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost <end>
he came back gay and self satisfied  eager and busy  caring nothing
for miss woodhouse  and defying miss smith <end>

the charming augusta hawkins  in addition to all the usual advantages
of perfect beauty and merit  was in possession of an independent fortune 
of so many thousands as would always be called ten  a point of
some dignity  as well as some convenience   the story told well 
he had not thrown himself away  he had gained a woman of 10 000 l <end>
or thereabouts  and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity  
the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by
distinguishing notice  the history which he had to give mrs <end> cole
of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious  the steps
so quick  from the accidental rencontre  to the dinner at mr <end> green s 
and the party at mrs <end> brown s  smiles and blushes rising in importance  
with consciousness and agitation richly scattered  the lady
had been so easily impressed  so sweetly disposed  had in short 
to use a most intelligible phrase  been so very ready to have him 
that vanity and prudence were equally contented <end>

he had caught both substance and shadow  both fortune and affection 
and was just the happy man he ought to be  talking only of himself
and his own concerns  expecting to be congratulated  ready to be
laughed at  and  with cordial  fearless smiles  now addressing
all the young ladies of the place  to whom  a few weeks ago 
he would have been more cautiously gallant <end>

the wedding was no distant event  as the parties had only themselves
to please  and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for 
and when he set out for bath again  there was a general expectation 
which a certain glance of mrs <end> cole s did not seem to contradict 
that when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride <end>

during his present short stay  emma had barely seen him  but just
enough to feel that the first meeting was over  and to give her
the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique
and pretension  now spread over his air <end>  she was  in fact 
beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing
at all  and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very
disagreeable feelings  that  except in a moral light  as a penance 
a lesson  a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind 
she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again <end>
she wished him very well  but he gave her pain  and his welfare
twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction <end>

the pain of his continued residence in highbury  however  must certainly
be lessened by his marriage <end>  many vain solicitudes would be prevented  
many awkwardnesses smoothed by it <end>  a  mrs <end>   elton  would be an excuse for
any change of intercourse  former intimacy might sink without remark <end>
it would be almost beginning their life of civility again <end>

of the lady  individually  emma thought very little <end>  she was good
enough for mr <end> elton  no doubt  accomplished enough for highbury  
handsome enough  to look plain  probably  by harriet s side <end>
as to connexion  there emma was perfectly easy  persuaded 
that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet 
he had done nothing <end>  on that article  truth seemed attainable <end>
 what  she was  must be uncertain  but  who  she was  might be found out 
and setting aside the 10 000 l <end>  it did not appear that she was at
all harriet s superior <end>  she brought no name  no blood  no alliance <end>
miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a bristol  
merchant  of course  he must be called  but  as the whole of the
profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate  it was
not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very
moderate also <end>  part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath 
but bristol was her home  the very heart of bristol  for though
the father and mother had died some years ago  an uncle remained  
in the law line  nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded
of him  than that he was in the law line  and with him the daughter
had lived <end>  emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney 
and too stupid to rise <end>  and all the grandeur of the connexion
seemed dependent on the elder sister  who was  very   well   married  
to a gentleman in a  great   way   near bristol  who kept two carriages 
that was the wind up of the history  that was the glory of
miss hawkins <end>

could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all 
she had talked her into love  but  alas  she was not so easily to be
talked out of it <end>  the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies
of harriet s mind was not to be talked away <end>  he might be superseded
by another  he certainly would indeed  nothing could be clearer 
even a robert martin would have been sufficient  but nothing else 
she feared  would cure her <end>  harriet was one of those  who 
having once begun  would be always in love <end>  and now  poor girl 
she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr <end> elton <end>
she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other <end>  emma saw
him only once  but two or three times every day harriet was sure
 just  to meet with him  or  just  to miss him   just  to hear his voice 
or see his shoulder   just  to have something occur to preserve him
in her fancy  in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture <end>
she was  moreover  perpetually hearing about him  for  excepting when
at hartfield  she was always among those who saw no fault in mr <end> elton 
and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns 
and every report  therefore  every guess  all that had already
occurred  all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs 
comprehending income  servants  and furniture  was continually
in agitation around her <end>  her regard was receiving strength by
invariable praise of him  and her regrets kept alive  and feelings
irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkins s happiness 
and continual observation of  how much he seemed attached   
his air as he walked by the house  the very sitting of his hat 
being all in proof of how much he was in love 

had it been allowable entertainment  had there been no pain
to her friend  or reproach to herself  in the waverings of
harriet s mind  emma would have been amused by its variations <end>
sometimes mr <end> elton predominated  sometimes the martins  and each
was occasionally useful as a check to the other <end>  mr <end> elton s
engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr <end> martin <end>
the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been
a little put aside by elizabeth martin s calling at mrs <end> goddard s
a few days afterwards <end>  harriet had not been at home  but a note had
been prepared and left for her  written in the very style to touch 
a small mixture of reproach  with a great deal of kindness 
and till mr <end> elton himself appeared  she had been much occupied
by it  continually pondering over what could be done in return 
and wishing to do more than she dared to confess <end>  but mr <end> elton 
in person  had driven away all such cares <end>  while he staid 
the martins were forgotten  and on the very morning of his setting off
for bath again  emma  to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned 
judged it best for her to return elizabeth martin s visit <end>

how that visit was to be acknowledged  what would be necessary  
and what might be safest  had been a point of some doubtful
consideration <end>  absolute neglect of the mother and sisters 
when invited to come  would be ingratitude <end>  it must not be 
and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance   

after much thinking  she could determine on nothing better  than harriet s
returning the visit  but in a way that  if they had understanding 
should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance <end>
she meant to take her in the carriage  leave her at the abbey mill 
while she drove a little farther  and call for her again so soon 
as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous
recurrences to the past  and give the most decided proof of what
degree of intimacy was chosen for the future <end>

she could think of nothing better   and though there was something
in it which her own heart could not approve  something of ingratitude 
merely glossed over  it must be done  or what would become of harriet 



chapter v


small heart had harriet for visiting <end>  only half an hour before her
friend called for her at mrs <end> goddard s  her evil stars had led
her to the very spot where  at that moment  a trunk  directed to
 the rev <end> philip elton  white hart  bath   was to be seen under the
operation of being lifted into the butcher s cart  which was to
convey it to where the coaches past  and every thing in this world 
excepting that trunk and the direction  was consequently a blank <end>

she went  however  and when they reached the farm  and she was to
be put down  at the end of the broad  neat gravel walk  which led
between espalier apple trees to the front door  the sight of every
thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before 
was beginning to revive a little local agitation  and when they parted 
emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity 
which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed
quarter of an hour <end>  she went on herself  to give that portion
of time to an old servant who was married  and settled in donwell <end>

the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again 
and miss smith receiving her summons  was with her without delay 
and unattended by any alarming young man <end>  she came solitarily
down the gravel walk  a miss martin just appearing at the door 
and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility <end>

harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account <end>
she was feeling too much  but at last emma collected from her
enough to understand the sort of meeting  and the sort of pain it
was creating <end>  she had seen only mrs <end> martin and the two girls <end>
they had received her doubtingly  if not coolly  and nothing
beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time  
till just at last  when mrs <end> martin s saying  all of a sudden 
that she thought miss smith was grown  had brought on a more
interesting subject  and a warmer manner <end>  in that very room
she had been measured last september  with her two friends <end>
there were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by
the window <end>   he  had done it <end>  they all seemed to remember the day 
the hour  the party  the occasion  to feel the same consciousness 
the same regrets  to be ready to return to the same good understanding 
and they were just growing again like themselves   harriet  as emma
must suspect  as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy  
when the carriage reappeared  and all was over <end>  the style of
the visit  and the shortness of it  were then felt to be decisive <end>
fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully
passed six weeks not six months ago   emma could not but picture
it all  and feel how justly they might resent  how naturally
harriet must suffer <end>  it was a bad business <end>  she would have given
a great deal  or endured a great deal  to have had the martins
in a higher rank of life <end>  they were so deserving  that a  little 
higher should have been enough   but as it was  how could she have
done otherwise   impossible   she could not repent <end>  they must
be separated  but there was a great deal of pain in the process  
so much to herself at this time  that she soon felt the necessity
of a little consolation  and resolved on going home by way of randalls
to procure it <end>  her mind was quite sick of mr <end> elton and the martins <end>
the refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary <end>

it was a good scheme  but on driving to the door they heard
that neither  master nor mistress was at home   they had both
been out some time  the man believed they were gone to hartfield <end>

 this is too bad   cried emma  as they turned away <end>   and now we
shall just miss them  too provoking   i do not know when i have been
so disappointed <end>   and she leaned back in the corner  to indulge
her murmurs  or to reason them away  probably a little of both  
such being the commonest process of a not ill disposed mind <end>
presently the carriage stopt  she looked up  it was stopt
by mr <end> and mrs <end> weston  who were standing to speak to her <end>
there was instant pleasure in the sight of them  and still greater
pleasure was conveyed in sound  for mr <end> weston immediately accosted
her with 

 how d ye do   how d ye do   we have been sitting with your father  
glad to see him so well <end>  frank comes to morrow  i had a letter
this morning  we see him to morrow by dinner time to a certainty  
he is at oxford to day  and he comes for a whole fortnight  i knew it would
be so <end>  if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days 
i was always glad he did not come at christmas  now we are going
to have just the right weather for him  fine  dry  settled weather <end>
we shall enjoy him completely  every thing has turned out exactly
as we could wish <end> 

there was no resisting such news  no possibility of avoiding the
influence of such a happy face as mr <end> weston s  confirmed as it all
was by the words and the countenance of his wife  fewer and quieter 
but not less to the purpose <end>  to know that  she  thought his coming
certain was enough to make emma consider it so  and sincerely did
she rejoice in their joy <end>  it was a most delightful reanimation
of exhausted spirits <end>  the worn out past was sunk in the freshness
of what was coming  and in the rapidity of half a moment s thought 
she hoped mr <end> elton would now be talked of no more <end>

mr <end> weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe 
which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at
his command  as well as the route and the method of his journey 
and she listened  and smiled  and congratulated <end>

 i shall soon bring him over to hartfield   said he  at the conclusion <end>

emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech 
from his wife <end>

 we had better move on  mr <end> weston   said she   we are detaining
the girls <end> 

 well  well  i am ready    and turning again to emma   but you must
not be expecting such a  very  fine young man  you have only had  my 
account you know  i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary    
though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very
different conviction <end>

emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent  and answer
in a manner that appropriated nothing <end>

 think of me to morrow  my dear emma  about four o clock  
was mrs <end> weston s parting injunction  spoken with some anxiety 
and meant only for her <end>

 four o clock   depend upon it he will be here by three   was mr <end> weston s
quick amendment  and so ended a most satisfactory meeting <end>
emma s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness  every thing wore
a different air  james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish
as before <end>  when she looked at the hedges  she thought the elder at
least must soon be coming out  and when she turned round to harriet 
she saw something like a look of spring  a tender smile even there <end>

 will mr <end> frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford    
was a question  however  which did not augur much <end>

but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once 
and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come
in time <end>

the morning of the interesting day arrived  and mrs <end> weston s
faithful pupil did not forget either at ten  or eleven  or twelve
o clock  that she was to think of her at four <end>

 my dear  dear anxious friend    said she  in mental soliloquy 
while walking downstairs from her own room   always overcareful
for every body s comfort but your own  i see you now in all your
little fidgets  going again and again into his room  to be sure
that all is right <end>   the clock struck twelve as she passed through
the hall <end>    tis twelve  i shall not forget to think of you four
hours hence  and by this time to morrow  perhaps  or a little later 
i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here <end>
i am sure they will bring him soon <end> 

she opened the parlour door  and saw two gentlemen sitting with
her father  mr <end> weston and his son <end>  they had been arrived only
a few minutes  and mr <end> weston had scarcely finished his explanation
of frank s being a day before his time  and her father was yet
in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations  when
she appeared  to have her share of surprize  introduction  and pleasure <end>

the frank churchill so long talked of  so high in interest 
was actually before her  he was presented to her  and she did
not think too much had been said in his praise  he was a  very  good
looking young man  height  air  address  all were unexceptionable 
and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness
of his father s  he looked quick and sensible <end>  she felt immediately
that she should like him  and there was a well bred ease of manner 
and a readiness to talk  which convinced her that he came intending
to be acquainted with her  and that acquainted they soon must be <end>

he had reached randalls the evening before <end>  she was pleased
with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan 
and travel earlier  later  and quicker  that he might gain half
a day <end>

 i told you yesterday   cried mr <end> weston with exultation   i told
you all that he would be here before the time named <end>  i remembered
what i used to do myself <end>  one cannot creep upon a journey 
one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned  and the
pleasure of coming in upon one s friends before the look out begins 
is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs <end> 

 it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it   said the young man 
 though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far 
but in coming  home  i felt i might do any thing <end> 

the word  home  made his father look on him with fresh complacency <end>
emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable 
the conviction was strengthened by what followed <end>  he was very much
pleased with randalls  thought it a most admirably arranged house 
would hardly allow it even to be very small  admired the situation 
the walk to highbury  highbury itself  hartfield still more 
and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest
in the country which none but one s  own  country gives  and the
greatest curiosity to visit it <end>  that he should never have been
able to indulge so amiable a feeling before  passed suspiciously
through emma s brain  but still  if it were a falsehood  it was a
pleasant one  and pleasantly handled <end>  his manner had no air of study
or exaggeration <end>  he did really look and speak as if in a state of no
common enjoyment <end>

their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance <end>
on his side were the inquiries    was she a horsewoman   pleasant rides   
pleasant walks   had they a large neighbourhood   highbury  perhaps 
afforded society enough   there were several very pretty houses
in and about it <end>  balls  had they balls   was it a musical society  

but when satisfied on all these points  and their acquaintance
proportionably advanced  he contrived to find an opportunity 
while their two fathers were engaged with each other  of introducing
his mother in law  and speaking of her with so much handsome praise 
so much warm admiration  so much gratitude for the happiness she
secured to his father  and her very kind reception of himself 
as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please  
and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her <end>
he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be
thoroughly deserved by mrs <end> weston  but  undoubtedly he could know
very little of the matter <end>  he understood what would be welcome 
he could be sure of little else <end>   his father s marriage   he said 
 had been the wisest measure  every friend must rejoice in it 
and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must
be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation
on him <end> 

he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylor s merits 
without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it
was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouse s
character  than miss woodhouse miss taylor s <end> and at last  as if resolved
to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object  he
wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person <end>

 elegant  agreeable manners  i was prepared for   said he 
 but i confess that  considering every thing  i had not expected
more than a very tolerably well looking woman of a certain age 
i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs <end> weston <end> 

 you cannot see too much perfection in mrs <end> weston for my feelings  
said emma   were you to guess her to be  eighteen   i should listen
with pleasure  but  she  would be ready to quarrel with you for using
such words <end>  don t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as
a pretty young woman <end> 

 i hope i should know better   he replied   no  depend upon it 
 with a gallant bow   that in addressing mrs <end> weston i should
understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought
extravagant in my terms <end> 

emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected
from their knowing each other  which had taken strong possession
of her mind  had ever crossed his  and whether his compliments were
to be considered as marks of acquiescence  or proofs of defiance <end>
she must see more of him to understand his ways  at present she
only felt they were agreeable <end>

she had no doubt of what mr <end> weston was often thinking about <end>
his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them
with a happy expression  and even  when he might have determined not
to look  she was confident that he was often listening <end>

her own father s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind 
the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration
or suspicion  was a most comfortable circumstance <end>  happily he
was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it <end>  
though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged 
he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any 
it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons 
understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were
proved against them <end>  she blessed the favouring blindness <end>
he could now  without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise 
without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest 
give way to all his natural kind hearted civility in solicitous
inquiries after mr <end> frank churchill s accommodation on his journey 
through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road  and express
very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped
catching cold  which  however  he could not allow him to feel quite
assured of himself till after another night <end>

a reasonable visit paid  mr <end> weston began to move <end>   he must be going <end>
he had business at the crown about his hay  and a great many errands
for mrs <end> weston at ford s  but he need not hurry any body else <end> 
his son  too well bred to hear the hint  rose immediately also 
saying 

 as you are going farther on business  sir  i will take the
opportunity of paying a visit  which must be paid some day or other 
and therefore may as well be paid now <end>  i have the honour of being
acquainted with a neighbour of yours   turning to emma   a lady
residing in or near highbury  a family of the name of fairfax <end>
i shall have no difficulty  i suppose  in finding the house 
though fairfax  i believe  is not the proper name  i should rather
say barnes  or bates <end>  do you know any family of that name  

 to be sure we do   cried his father   mrs <end> bates  we passed her house  
i saw miss bates at the window <end>  true  true  you are acquainted
with miss fairfax  i remember you knew her at weymouth  and a fine
girl she is <end>  call upon her  by all means <end> 

 there is no necessity for my calling this morning   said the
young man   another day would do as well  but there was that degree
of acquaintance at weymouth which   

 oh  go to day  go to day <end> do not defer it <end>  what is right to be done
cannot be done too soon <end>  and  besides  i must give you a hint  frank 
any want of attention to her  here  should be carefully avoided <end>
you saw her with the campbells  when she was the equal of every body
she mixed with  but here she is with a poor old grandmother 
who has barely enough to live on <end>  if you do not call early it
will be a slight <end> 

the son looked convinced <end>

 i have heard her speak of the acquaintance   said emma   she is
a very elegant young woman <end> 

he agreed to it  but with so quiet a  yes   as inclined her almost
to doubt his real concurrence  and yet there must be a very distinct
sort of elegance for the fashionable world  if jane fairfax could
be thought only ordinarily gifted with it <end>

 if you were never particularly struck by her manners before  
said she   i think you will to day <end> you will see her to advantage 
see her and hear her  no  i am afraid you will not hear her at all 
for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue <end> 

 you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax  sir  are you  
said mr <end> woodhouse  always the last to make his way in conversation 
 then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very
agreeable young lady <end>  she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama
and aunt  very worthy people  i have known them all my life <end>
they will be extremely glad to see you  i am sure  and one of my
servants shall go with you to shew you the way <end> 

 my dear sir  upon no account in the world  my father can direct me <end> 

 but your father is not going so far  he is only going to the crown 
quite on the other side of the street  and there are a great many houses 
you might be very much at a loss  and it is a very dirty walk 
unless you keep on the footpath  but my coachman can tell you
where you had best cross the street <end> 

mr <end> frank churchill still declined it  looking as serious as he could 
and his father gave his hearty support by calling out   my good friend 
this is quite unnecessary  frank knows a puddle of water when he
sees it  and as to mrs <end> bates s  he may get there from the crown
in a hop  step  and jump <end> 

they were permitted to go alone  and with a cordial nod from one 
and a graceful bow from the other  the two gentlemen took leave <end>
emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance 
and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of
the day  with full confidence in their comfort <end>



chapter vi


the next morning brought mr <end> frank churchill again <end>  he came with
mrs <end> weston  to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially <end>
he had been sitting with her  it appeared  most companionably at home 
till her usual hour of exercise  and on being desired to chuse
their walk  immediately fixed on highbury <end>   he did not doubt there
being very pleasant walks in every direction  but if left to him 
he should always chuse the same <end>  highbury  that airy  cheerful 
happy looking highbury  would be his constant attraction <end>   
highbury  with mrs <end> weston  stood for hartfield  and she trusted to
its bearing the same construction with him <end>  they walked thither directly <end>

emma had hardly expected them   for mr <end> weston  who had called in
for half a minute  in order to hear that his son was very handsome 
knew nothing of their plans  and it was an agreeable surprize
to her  therefore  to perceive them walking up to the house together 
arm in arm <end>  she was wanting to see him again  and especially
to see him in company with mrs <end> weston  upon his behaviour to whom
her opinion of him was to depend <end>  if he were deficient there 
nothing should make amends for it <end>  but on seeing them together 
she became perfectly satisfied <end>  it was not merely in fine words
or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty  nothing could be
more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her  nothing could
more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and
securing her affection <end>  and there was time enough for emma to form a
reasonable judgment  as their visit included all the rest of the morning <end>
they were all three walking about together for an hour or two  
first round the shrubberies of hartfield  and afterwards in highbury <end>
he was delighted with every thing  admired hartfield sufficiently
for mr <end> woodhouse s ear  and when their going farther was resolved on 
confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village 
and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma
could have supposed <end>

some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings <end>
he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long 
and which had been the home of his father s father  and on recollecting
that an old woman who had nursed him was still living  walked in quest
of her cottage from one end of the street to the other  and though
in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit 
they shewed  altogether  a good will towards highbury in general 
which must be very like a merit to those he was with <end>

emma watched and decided  that with such feelings as were now shewn 
it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily
absenting himself  that he had not been acting a part  or making
a parade of insincere professions  and that mr <end> knightley certainly
had not done him justice <end>

their first pause was at the crown inn  an inconsiderable house 
though the principal one of the sort  where a couple of pair of
post horses were kept  more for the convenience of the neighbourhood
than from any run on the road  and his companions had not expected
to be detained by any interest excited there  but in passing it they
gave the history of the large room visibly added  it had been built
many years ago for a ball room  and while the neighbourhood had been
in a particularly populous  dancing state  had been occasionally used
as such   but such brilliant days had long passed away  and now the
highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist
club established among the gentlemen and half gentlemen of the place <end>
he was immediately interested <end>  its character as a ball room caught him 
and instead of passing on  he stopt for several minutes at the two
superior sashed windows which were open  to look in and contemplate
its capabilities  and lament that its original purpose should
have ceased <end>  he saw no fault in the room  he would acknowledge
none which they suggested <end>  no  it was long enough  broad enough 
handsome enough <end>  it would hold the very number for comfort <end>
they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through
the winter <end>  why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good
old days of the room   she who could do any thing in highbury 
the want of proper families in the place  and the conviction
that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be
tempted to attend  were mentioned  but he was not satisfied <end>
he could not be persuaded that so many good looking houses as he saw
around him  could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting 
and even when particulars were given and families described  he was
still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture
would be any thing  or that there would be the smallest difficulty
in every body s returning into their proper place the next morning <end>
he argued like a young man very much bent on dancing  and emma
was rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail
so decidedly against the habits of the churchills <end>  he seemed to have
all the life and spirit  cheerful feelings  and social inclinations
of his father  and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe <end>
of pride  indeed  there was  perhaps  scarcely enough  his indifference
to a confusion of rank  bordered too much on inelegance of mind <end>
he could be no judge  however  of the evil he was holding cheap <end>
it was but an effusion of lively spirits <end>

at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown 
and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged 
emma recollected his intended visit the day before  and asked him
if he had paid it <end>

 yes  oh  yes   he replied   i was just going to mention it <end>
a very successful visit   i saw all the three ladies  and felt very
much obliged to you for your preparatory hint <end>  if the talking aunt
had taken me quite by surprize  it must have been the death of me <end>
as it was  i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit <end>
ten minutes would have been all that was necessary  perhaps all that
was proper  and i had told my father i should certainly be at home
before him  but there was no getting away  no pause  and  to my
utter astonishment  i found  when he  finding me nowhere else 
joined me there at last  that i had been actually sitting with them
very nearly three quarters of an hour <end>  the good lady had not given me
the possibility of escape before <end> 

 and how did you think miss fairfax looking  

 ill  very ill  that is  if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill <end>
but the expression is hardly admissible  mrs <end> weston  is it 
ladies can never look ill <end>  and  seriously  miss fairfax is naturally
so pale  as almost always to give the appearance of ill health <end>  
a most deplorable want of complexion <end> 

emma would not agree to this  and began a warm defence of miss
fairfax s complexion <end>   it was certainly never brilliant  but she
would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general  and there was
a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance
to the character of her face <end>   he listened with all due deference 
acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same  but yet he
must confess  that to him nothing could make amends for the want
of the fine glow of health <end>  where features were indifferent 
a fine complexion gave beauty to them all  and where they were good 
the effect was  fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the
effect was <end>

 well   said emma   there is no disputing about taste <end>  at least
you admire her except her complexion <end> 

he shook his head and laughed <end>   i cannot separate miss fairfax
and her complexion <end> 

 did you see her often at weymouth   were you often in the same society  

at this moment they were approaching ford s  and he hastily exclaimed 
 ha  this must be the very shop that every body attends every day
of their lives  as my father informs me <end>  he comes to highbury himself 
he says  six days out of the seven  and has always business at ford s <end>
if it be not inconvenient to you  pray let us go in  that i may prove
myself to belong to the place  to be a true citizen of highbury <end>
i must buy something at ford s <end> it will be taking out my freedom <end>  
i dare say they sell gloves <end> 

 oh  yes  gloves and every thing <end>  i do admire your patriotism <end>
you will be adored in highbury <end>  you were very popular before you came 
because you were mr <end> weston s son  but lay out half a guinea at
ford s  and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues <end> 

they went in  and while the sleek  well tied parcels of  men s beavers 
and  york tan  were bringing down and displaying on the counter 
he said   but i beg your pardon  miss woodhouse  you were speaking
to me  you were saying something at the very moment of this burst
of my  amor   patriae  <end>  do not let me lose it <end>  i assure you the utmost
stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any
happiness in private life <end> 

 i merely asked  whether you had known much of miss fairfax
and her party at weymouth <end> 

 and now that i understand your question  i must pronounce it to be a
very unfair one <end>  it is always the lady s right to decide on the degree
of acquaintance <end>  miss fairfax must already have given her account <end>  
i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow <end> 

 upon my word  you answer as discreetly as she could do herself <end>
but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed 
she is so very reserved  so very unwilling to give the least
information about any body  that i really think you may say what you
like of your acquaintance with her <end> 

 may i  indeed   then i will speak the truth  and nothing suits me
so well <end>  i met her frequently at weymouth <end>  i had known the campbells
a little in town  and at weymouth we were very much in the same set <end>
colonel campbell is a very agreeable man  and mrs <end> campbell a friendly 
warm hearted woman <end>  i like them all <end> 

 you know miss fairfax s situation in life  i conclude  what she
is destined to be  

 yes   rather hesitatingly   i believe i do <end> 

 you get upon delicate subjects  emma   said mrs <end> weston smiling 
 remember that i am here <end>  mr <end> frank churchill hardly knows
what to say when you speak of miss fairfax s situation in life <end>
i will move a little farther off <end> 

 i certainly do forget to think of  her    said emma   as having ever
been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend <end> 

he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment <end>

when the gloves were bought  and they had quitted the shop again 
 did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of  play  
said frank churchill <end>

 ever hear her   repeated emma <end>   you forget how much she belongs
to highbury <end>  i have heard her every year of our lives since we
both began <end>  she plays charmingly <end> 

 you think so  do you   i wanted the opinion of some one who
could really judge <end>  she appeared to me to play well  that is 
with considerable taste  but i know nothing of the matter myself <end>  
i am excessively fond of music  but without the smallest skill
or right of judging of any body s performance <end>  i have been used
to hear her s admired  and i remember one proof of her being
thought to play well   a man  a very musical man  and in love
with another woman  engaged to her  on the point of marriage  
would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument 
if the lady in question could sit down instead  never seemed
to like to hear one if he could hear the other <end>  that  i thought 
in a man of known musical talent  was some proof <end> 

 proof indeed   said emma  highly amused <end>   mr <end> dixon is very musical 
is he   we shall know more about them all  in half an hour  from you 
than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year <end> 

 yes  mr <end> dixon and miss campbell were the persons  and i thought
it a very strong proof <end> 

 certainly  very strong it was  to own the truth  a great deal
stronger than  if  i  had been miss campbell  would have been at all
agreeable to me <end>  i could not excuse a man s having more music
than love  more ear than eye  a more acute sensibility to fine
sounds than to my feelings <end>  how did miss campbell appear to like it  

 it was her very particular friend  you know <end> 

 poor comfort   said emma  laughing <end>   one would rather have a stranger
preferred than one s very particular friend  with a stranger it might
not recur again  but the misery of having a very particular friend
always at hand  to do every thing better than one does oneself   
poor mrs <end> dixon   well  i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland <end> 

 you are right <end>  it was not very flattering to miss campbell 
but she really did not seem to feel it <end> 

 so much the better  or so much the worse   i do not know which <end>
but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her  quickness of friendship 
or dulness of feeling  there was one person  i think  who must have
felt it   miss fairfax herself <end>  she must have felt the improper
and dangerous distinction <end> 

 as to that  i do not   

 oh  do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfax s
sensations from you  or from any body else <end>  they are known to no
human being  i guess  but herself <end>  but if she continued to play
whenever she was asked by mr <end> dixon  one may guess what one chuses <end> 

 there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all   
he began rather quickly  but checking himself  added   however  it
is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were  
how it might all be behind the scenes <end>  i can only say that there
was smoothness outwardly <end>  but you  who have known miss fairfax from
a child  must be a better judge of her character  and of how she
is likely to conduct herself in critical situations  than i can be <end> 

 i have known her from a child  undoubtedly  we have been children
and women together  and it is natural to suppose that we should
be intimate   that we should have taken to each other whenever
she visited her friends <end>  but we never did <end>  i hardly know how it
has happened  a little  perhaps  from that wickedness on my side
which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized
and so cried up as she always was  by her aunt and grandmother 
and all their set <end>  and then  her reserve  i never could attach
myself to any one so completely reserved <end> 

 it is a most repulsive quality  indeed   said he <end>   oftentimes
very convenient  no doubt  but never pleasing <end>  there is safety
in reserve  but no attraction <end>  one cannot love a reserved person <end> 

 not till the reserve ceases towards oneself  and then the attraction
may be the greater <end>  but i must be more in want of a friend 
or an agreeable companion  than i have yet been  to take
the trouble of conquering any body s reserve to procure one <end>
intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question <end>
i have no reason to think ill of her  not the least  except that
such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner 
such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body  is apt
to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal <end> 

he perfectly agreed with her   and after walking together so long 
and thinking so much alike  emma felt herself so well acquainted with him 
that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting <end>
he was not exactly what she had expected  less of the man of the
world in some of his notions  less of the spoiled child of fortune 
therefore better than she had expected <end>  his ideas seemed more moderate  
his feelings warmer <end>  she was particularly struck by his manner
of considering mr <end> elton s house  which  as well as the church 
he would go and look at  and would not join them in finding much
fault with <end>  no  he could not believe it a bad house  not such a house
as a man was to be pitied for having <end>  if it were to be shared with
the woman he loved  he could not think any man to be pitied for having
that house <end>  there must be ample room in it for every real comfort <end>
the man must be a blockhead who wanted more <end>

mrs <end> weston laughed  and said he did not know what he was talking about <end>
used only to a large house himself  and without ever thinking how many
advantages and accommodations were attached to its size  he could
be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one <end>
but emma  in her own mind  determined that he  did  know what he
was talking about  and that he shewed a very amiable inclination
to settle early in life  and to marry  from worthy motives <end>
he might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be
occasioned by no housekeeper s room  or a bad butler s pantry 
but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make
him happy  and that whenever he were attached  he would willingly
give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment <end>



chapter vii


emma s very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken
the following day  by hearing that he was gone off to london 
merely to have his hair cut <end>  a sudden freak seemed to have seized him
at breakfast  and he had sent for a chaise and set off  intending to
return to dinner  but with no more important view that appeared than
having his hair cut <end>  there was certainly no harm in his travelling
sixteen miles twice over on such an errand  but there was an air
of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve <end>  it did
not accord with the rationality of plan  the moderation in expense 
or even the unselfish warmth of heart  which she had believed herself
to discern in him yesterday <end>  vanity  extravagance  love of change 
restlessness of temper  which must be doing something  good or bad 
heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and mrs <end> weston 
indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general  he became
liable to all these charges <end>  his father only called him a coxcomb 
and thought it a very good story  but that mrs <end> weston did not like it 
was clear enough  by her passing it over as quickly as possible 
and making no other comment than that  all young people would have
their little whims <end> 

with the exception of this little blot  emma found that his visit
hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him <end>  mrs <end> weston
was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he
made himself  how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether <end>
he appeared to have a very open temper  certainly a very cheerful
and lively one  she could observe nothing wrong in his notions 
a great deal decidedly right  he spoke of his uncle with warm regard 
was fond of talking of him  said he would be the best man in the
world if he were left to himself  and though there was no being
attached to the aunt  he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude 
and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect <end>
this was all very promising  and  but for such an unfortunate fancy
for having his hair cut  there was nothing to denote him unworthy
of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him 
the honour  if not of being really in love with her  of being
at least very near it  and saved only by her own indifference  
 for still her resolution held of never marrying   the honour  in short 
of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance <end>

mr <end> weston  on his side  added a virtue to the account which must
have some weight <end>  he gave her to understand that frank admired
her extremely  thought her very beautiful and very charming 
and with so much to be said for him altogether  she found she must
not judge him harshly <end>  as mrs <end> weston observed   all young people
would have their little whims <end> 

there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry  not so
leniently disposed <end>  in general he was judged  throughout the parishes
of donwell and highbury  with great candour  liberal allowances
were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man  
one who smiled so often and bowed so well  but there was one spirit
among them not to be softened  from its power of censure  by bows
or smiles  mr <end> knightley <end>  the circumstance was told him at hartfield 
for the moment  he was silent  but emma heard him almost immediately
afterwards say to himself  over a newspaper he held in his hand 
 hum  just the trifling  silly fellow i took him for <end>   she had
half a mind to resent  but an instant s observation convinced
her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings 
and not meant to provoke  and therefore she let it pass <end>

although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings 
mr <end> and mrs <end> weston s visit this morning was in another respect
particularly opportune <end>  something occurred while they were
at hartfield  to make emma want their advice  and  which was
still more lucky  she wanted exactly the advice they gave <end>

this was the occurrence   the coles had been settled some years
in highbury  and were very good sort of people  friendly  liberal 
and unpretending  but  on the other hand  they were of low origin 
in trade  and only moderately genteel <end>  on their first coming into
the country  they had lived in proportion to their income  quietly 
keeping little company  and that little unexpensively  but the last
year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means  
the house in town had yielded greater profits  and fortune in general
had smiled on them <end>  with their wealth  their views increased 
their want of a larger house  their inclination for more company <end>
they added to their house  to their number of servants 
to their expenses of every sort  and by this time were  in fortune
and style of living  second only to the family at hartfield <end>
their love of society  and their new dining room  prepared every body
for their keeping dinner company  and a few parties  chiefly among
the single men  had already taken place <end>  the regular and best
families emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite  
neither donwell  nor hartfield  nor randalls <end>  nothing should
tempt  her  to go  if they did  and she regretted that her father s
known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she
could wish <end>  the coles were very respectable in their way  but they
ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms
on which the superior families would visit them <end>  this lesson 
she very much feared  they would receive only from herself 
she had little hope of mr <end> knightley  none of mr <end> weston <end>

but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many
weeks before it appeared  that when the insult came at last 
it found her very differently affected <end>  donwell and randalls
had received their invitation  and none had come for her father
and herself  and mrs <end> weston s accounting for it with  i suppose
they will not take the liberty with you  they know you do not
dine out   was not quite sufficient <end>  she felt that she should
like to have had the power of refusal  and afterwards  as the idea
of the party to be assembled there  consisting precisely of those
whose society was dearest to her  occurred again and again 
she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept <end>
harriet was to be there in the evening  and the bateses <end>  they had
been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before 
and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence <end>
might not the evening end in a dance  had been a question of his <end>
the bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits 
and her being left in solitary grandeur  even supposing the omission
to be intended as a compliment  was but poor comfort <end>

it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were
at hartfield  which made their presence so acceptable  for though her
first remark  on reading it  was that  of course it must be declined  
she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do 
that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful <end>

she owned that  considering every thing  she was not absolutely
without inclination for the party <end>  the coles expressed themselves
so properly  there was so much real attention in the manner of it  
so much consideration for her father <end>   they would have solicited the
honour earlier  but had been waiting the arrival of a folding screen
from london  which they hoped might keep mr <end> woodhouse from any draught
of air  and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the
honour of his company <end>   upon the whole  she was very persuadable 
and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be
done without neglecting his comfort  how certainly mrs <end> goddard 
if not mrs <end> bates  might be depended on for bearing him company  
mr <end> woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter s
going out to dinner on a day now near at hand  and spending
the whole evening away from him <end>  as for  his  going  emma did
not wish him to think it possible  the hours would be too late 
and the party too numerous <end>  he was soon pretty well resigned <end>

 i am not fond of dinner visiting   said he   i never was <end>
no more is emma <end>  late hours do not agree with us <end>  i am sorry
mr <end> and mrs <end> cole should have done it <end>  i think it would be
much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer 
and take their tea with us  take us in their afternoon walk 
which they might do  as our hours are so reasonable  and yet get home
without being out in the damp of the evening <end>  the dews of a summer
evening are what i would not expose any body to <end>  however  as they
are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them  and as you
will both be there  and mr <end> knightley too  to take care of her 
i cannot wish to prevent it  provided the weather be what it ought 
neither damp  nor cold  nor windy <end>   then turning to mrs <end> weston 
with a look of gentle reproach   ah   miss taylor  if you had
not married  you would have staid at home with me <end> 

 well  sir   cried mr <end> weston   as i took miss taylor away 
it is incumbent on me to supply her place  if i can  and i will
step to mrs <end> goddard in a moment  if you wish it <end> 

but the idea of any thing to be done in a  moment   was increasing 
not lessening  mr <end> woodhouse s agitation <end>  the ladies knew better
how to allay it <end>  mr <end> weston must be quiet  and every thing
deliberately arranged <end>

with this treatment  mr <end> woodhouse was soon composed enough
for talking as usual <end>   he should be happy to see mrs <end> goddard <end>
he had a great regard for mrs <end> goddard  and emma should write a line 
and invite her <end>  james could take the note <end>  but first of all 
there must be an answer written to mrs <end> cole <end> 

 you will make my excuses  my dear  as civilly as possible <end>  you will
say that i am quite an invalid  and go no where  and therefore must
decline their obliging invitation  beginning with my  compliments  
of course <end>  but you will do every thing right <end>  i need not tell you
what is to be done <end>  we must remember to let james know that the carriage
will be wanted on tuesday <end>  i shall have no fears for you with him <end>
we have never been there above once since the new approach was made 
but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely <end>
and when you get there  you must tell him at what time you would
have him come for you again  and you had better name an early hour <end>
you will not like staying late <end>  you will get very tired when tea
is over <end> 

 but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired  papa  

 oh  no  my love  but you will soon be tired <end>  there will be
a great many people talking at once <end>  you will not like the noise <end> 

 but  my dear sir   cried mr <end> weston   if emma comes away early 
it will be breaking up the party <end> 

 and no great harm if it does   said mr <end> woodhouse <end>   the sooner
every party breaks up  the better <end> 

 but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles <end>
emma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence <end>
they are good natured people  and think little of their own claims 
but still they must feel that any body s hurrying away is no
great compliment  and miss woodhouse s doing it would be more thought
of than any other person s in the room <end>  you would not wish to disappoint
and mortify the coles  i am sure  sir  friendly  good sort of people
as ever lived  and who have been your neighbours these  ten  years <end> 

 no  upon no account in the world  mr <end> weston  i am much obliged
to you for reminding me <end>  i should be extremely sorry to be giving
them any pain <end>  i know what worthy people they are <end>  perry tells
me that mr <end> cole never touches malt liquor <end>  you would not think
it to look at him  but he is bilious  mr <end> cole is very bilious <end>
no  i would not be the means of giving them any pain <end>  my dear emma 
we must consider this <end>  i am sure  rather than run the risk of hurting
mr <end> and mrs <end> cole  you would stay a little longer than you might wish <end>
you will not regard being tired <end>  you will be perfectly safe 
you know  among your friends <end> 

 oh yes  papa <end>  i have no fears at all for myself  and i should have
no scruples of staying as late as mrs <end> weston  but on your account <end>
i am only afraid of your sitting up for me <end>  i am not afraid
of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs <end> goddard <end>
she loves piquet  you know  but when she is gone home  i am afraid
you will be sitting up by yourself  instead of going to bed at your
usual time  and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort <end>
you must promise me not to sit up <end> 

he did  on the condition of some promises on her side   such as that 
if she came home cold  she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly 
if hungry  that she would take something to eat  that her own maid
should sit up for her  and that serle and the butler should see
that every thing were safe in the house  as usual <end>



chapter viii


frank churchill came back again  and if he kept his father s
dinner waiting  it was not known at hartfield  for mrs <end> weston
was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr <end> woodhouse 
to betray any imperfection which could be concealed <end>

he came back  had had his hair cut  and laughed at himself with
a very good grace  but without seeming really at all ashamed
of what he had done <end>  he had no reason to wish his hair longer 
to conceal any confusion of face  no reason to wish the money unspent 
to improve his spirits <end>  he was quite as undaunted and as lively
as ever  and  after seeing him  emma thus moralised to herself   

 i do not know whether it ought to be so  but certainly silly things
do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an
impudent way <end>  wickedness is always wickedness  but folly is not
always folly <end>  it depends upon the character of those who handle it <end>
mr <end> knightley  he is  not  a trifling  silly young man <end>  if he were 
he would have done this differently <end>  he would either have gloried
in the achievement  or been ashamed of it <end>  there would have been
either the ostentation of a coxcomb  or the evasions of a mind too
weak to defend its own vanities <end>  no  i am perfectly sure that he
is not trifling or silly <end> 

with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again 
and for a longer time than hitherto  of judging of his general manners 
and by inference  of the meaning of his manners towards herself 
of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness
into her air  and of fancying what the observations of all those
might be  who were now seeing them together for the first time <end>

she meant to be very happy  in spite of the scene being laid at
mr <end> cole s  and without being able to forget that among the failings
of mr <end> elton  even in the days of his favour  none had disturbed
her more than his propensity to dine with mr <end> cole <end>

her father s comfort was amply secured  mrs <end> bates as well as
mrs <end> goddard being able to come  and her last pleasing duty 
before she left the house  was to pay her respects to them as
they sat together after dinner  and while her father was fondly
noticing the beauty of her dress  to make the two ladies all
the amends in her power  by helping them to large slices of cake
and full glasses of wine  for whatever unwilling self denial his
care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise
during the meal <end>  she had provided a plentiful dinner for them 
she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it <end>

she followed another carriage to mr <end> cole s door  and was pleased
to see that it was mr <end> knightley s  for mr <end> knightley keeping
no horses  having little spare money and a great deal of health 
activity  and independence  was too apt  in emma s opinion  to get
about as he could  and not use his carriage so often as became
the owner of donwell abbey <end>  she had an opportunity now of speaking
her approbation while warm from her heart  for he stopped to hand her out <end>

 this is coming as you should do   said she   like a gentleman <end>  
i am quite glad to see you <end> 

he thanked her  observing   how lucky that we should arrive at the same
moment  for  if we had met first in the drawing room  i doubt whether
you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual <end>  
you might not have distinguished how i came  by my look or manner <end> 

 yes i should  i am sure i should <end>  there is always a look of
consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know
to be beneath them <end>  you think you carry it off very well  i dare say 
but with you it is a sort of bravado  an air of affected unconcern 
i always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances <end>
 now  you have nothing to try for <end>  you are not afraid of being
supposed ashamed <end>  you are not striving to look taller than any
body else <end>   now  i shall really be very happy to walk into the same
room with you <end> 

 nonsensical girl   was his reply  but not at all in anger <end>

emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party
as with mr <end> knightley <end>  she was received with a cordial respect
which could not but please  and given all the consequence she could
wish for <end>  when the westons arrived  the kindest looks of love 
the strongest of admiration were for her  from both husband and wife 
the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked
her as his peculiar object  and at dinner she found him seated
by her  and  as she firmly believed  not without some dexterity
on his side <end>

the party was rather large  as it included one other family  a proper
unobjectionable country family  whom the coles had the advantage of
naming among their acquaintance  and the male part of mr <end> cox s family 
the lawyer of highbury <end>  the less worthy females were to come
in the evening  with miss bates  miss fairfax  and miss smith 
but already  at dinner  they were too numerous for any subject
of conversation to be general  and  while politics and mr <end> elton
were talked over  emma could fairly surrender all her attention to
the pleasantness of her neighbour <end>  the first remote sound to which
she felt herself obliged to attend  was the name of jane fairfax <end>
mrs <end> cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be
very interesting <end>  she listened  and found it well worth listening to <end>
that very dear part of emma  her fancy  received an amusing supply <end>
mrs <end> cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates 
and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight
of a pianoforte  a very elegant looking instrument  not a grand 
but a large sized square pianoforte  and the substance of the story 
the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize  and inquiry 
and congratulations on her side  and explanations on miss bates s  was 
that this pianoforte had arrived from broadwood s the day before 
to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece  entirely unexpected 
that at first  by miss bates s account  jane herself was quite at
a loss  quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it  
but now  they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only
one quarter   of course it must be from colonel campbell <end>

 one can suppose nothing else   added mrs <end> cole   and i was only
surprized that there could ever have been a doubt <end>  but jane 
it seems  had a letter from them very lately  and not a word was said
about it <end>  she knows their ways best  but i should not consider their
silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present <end>
they might chuse to surprize her <end> 

mrs <end> cole had many to agree with her  every body who spoke on the
subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell 
and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made  and there
were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way 
and still listen to mrs <end> cole <end>

 i declare  i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given
me more satisfaction   it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax 
who plays so delightfully  should not have an instrument <end>
it seemed quite a shame  especially considering how many houses
there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away <end>
this is like giving ourselves a slap  to be sure  and it was
but yesterday i was telling mr <end> cole  i really was ashamed
to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing room  while i
do not know one note from another  and our little girls  who are
but just beginning  perhaps may never make any thing of it 
and there is poor jane fairfax  who is mistress of music  has not
any thing of the nature of an instrument  not even the pitifullest
old spinet in the world  to amuse herself with <end>  i was saying this
to mr <end> cole but yesterday  and he quite agreed with me  only he
is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging
himself in the purchase  hoping that some of our good neighbours might
be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can 
and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought  
or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it <end>  we are in great
hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening <end> 

miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence  and finding that nothing
more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs <end> cole s 
turned to frank churchill <end>

 why do you smile   said she <end>

 nay  why do you  

 me   i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell s being
so rich and so liberal <end>  it is a handsome present <end> 

 very <end> 

 i rather wonder that it was never made before <end> 

 perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before <end> 

 or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument  
which must now be shut up in london  untouched by any body <end> 

 that is a grand pianoforte  and he might think it too large
for mrs <end> bates s house <end> 

 you may  say  what you chuse  but your countenance testifies
that your  thoughts  on this subject are very much like mine <end> 

 i do not know <end>  i rather believe you are giving me more credit for
acuteness than i deserve <end>  i smile because you smile  and shall probably
suspect whatever i find you suspect  but at present i do not see what
there is to question <end>  if colonel campbell is not the person  who can be  

 what do you say to mrs <end> dixon  

 mrs <end> dixon  very true indeed <end>  i had not thought of mrs <end> dixon <end>
she must know as well as her father  how acceptable an instrument
would be  and perhaps the mode of it  the mystery  the surprize 
is more like a young woman s scheme than an elderly man s <end> it
is mrs <end> dixon  i dare say <end>  i told you that your suspicions would
guide mine <end> 

 if so  you must extend your suspicions and comprehend  mr  <end> dixon
in them <end> 

 mr <end> dixon <end>  very well <end>  yes  i immediately perceive that it must
be the joint present of mr <end> and mrs <end> dixon <end>  we were speaking the
other day  you know  of his being so warm an admirer of her performance <end> 

 yes  and what you told me on that head  confirmed an idea which i
had entertained before <end>  i do not mean to reflect upon the good
intentions of either mr <end> dixon or miss fairfax  but i cannot help
suspecting either that  after making his proposals to her friend 
he had the misfortune to fall in love with  her   or that he became
conscious of a little attachment on her side <end>  one might guess
twenty things without guessing exactly the right  but i am sure
there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury
instead of going with the campbells to ireland <end>  here  she must be
leading a life of privation and penance  there it would have been
all enjoyment <end>  as to the pretence of trying her native air  i look
upon that as a mere excuse <end>  in the summer it might have passed 
but what can any body s native air do for them in the months
of january  february  and march   good fires and carriages would
be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health  and i
dare say in her s <end> i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions 
though you make so noble a profession of doing it  but i honestly
tell you what they are <end> 

 and  upon my word  they have an air of great probability <end>
mr <end> dixon s preference of her music to her friend s  i can answer
for being very decided <end> 

 and then  he saved her life <end>  did you ever hear of that   
a water party  and by some accident she was falling overboard <end>
he caught her <end> 

 he did <end>  i was there  one of the party <end> 

 were you really   well   but you observed nothing of course 
for it seems to be a new idea to you <end>  if i had been there  i think
i should have made some discoveries <end> 

 i dare say you would  but i  simple i  saw nothing but the fact 
that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr <end> dixon
caught her <end>  it was the work of a moment <end>  and though the consequent
shock and alarm was very great and much more durable  indeed i
believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again  
yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar
anxiety to be observable <end>  i do not mean to say  however  that you
might not have made discoveries <end> 

the conversation was here interrupted <end>  they were called on to share
in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses 
and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others  but when
the table was again safely covered  when every corner dish was placed
exactly right  and occupation and ease were generally restored 
emma said 

 the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me <end>  i wanted to know
a little more  and this tells me quite enough <end>  depend upon it 
we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr <end> and mrs <end> dixon <end> 

 and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we
must conclude it to come from the campbells <end> 

 no  i am sure it is not from the campbells <end>  miss fairfax knows it
is not from the campbells  or they would have been guessed at first <end>
she would not have been puzzled  had she dared fix on them <end>
i may not have convinced you perhaps  but i am perfectly convinced
myself that mr <end> dixon is a principal in the business <end> 

 indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced <end>  your reasonings
carry my judgment along with them entirely <end>  at first  while i
supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver  i saw
it only as paternal kindness  and thought it the most natural thing
in the world <end>  but when you mentioned mrs <end> dixon  i felt how much more
probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship <end>
and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love <end> 

there was no occasion to press the matter farther <end>  the conviction
seemed real  he looked as if he felt it <end>  she said no more 
other subjects took their turn  and the rest of the dinner passed away 
the dessert succeeded  the children came in  and were talked
to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation  a few clever
things said  a few downright silly  but by much the larger proportion
neither the one nor the other  nothing worse than everyday remarks 
dull repetitions  old news  and heavy jokes <end>

the ladies had not been long in the drawing room  before the other ladies 
in their different divisions  arrived <end>  emma watched the entree of her
own particular little friend  and if she could not exult in her dignity
and grace  she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the
artless manner  but could most heartily rejoice in that light  cheerful 
unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations
of pleasure  in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection <end>
there she sat  and who would have guessed how many tears she had
been lately shedding   to be in company  nicely dressed herself
and seeing others nicely dressed  to sit and smile and look pretty 
and say nothing  was enough for the happiness of the present hour <end>
jane fairfax did look and move superior  but emma suspected she
might have been glad to change feelings with harriet  very glad
to have purchased the mortification of having loved  yes  of having
loved even mr <end> elton in vain  by the surrender of all the dangerous
pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend <end>

in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her <end>
she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte  she felt too much
in the secret herself  to think the appearance of curiosity
or interest fair  and therefore purposely kept at a distance 
but by the others  the subject was almost immediately introduced 
and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations
were received  the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of  my
excellent friend colonel campbell <end> 

mrs <end> weston  kind hearted and musical  was particularly interested
by the circumstance  and emma could not help being amused at her
perseverance in dwelling on the subject  and having so much to ask
and to say as to tone  touch  and pedal  totally unsuspicious
of that wish of saying as little about it as possible  which she
plainly read in the fair heroine s countenance <end>

they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen  and the very first of the
early was frank churchill <end>  in he walked  the first and the handsomest 
and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and
her niece  made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle 
where sat miss woodhouse  and till he could find a seat by her 
would not sit at all <end>  emma divined what every body present must
be thinking <end>  she was his object  and every body must perceive it <end>
she introduced him to her friend  miss smith  and  at convenient
moments afterwards  heard what each thought of the other <end>   he had
never seen so lovely a face  and was delighted with her naivete <end> 
and she   only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment 
but she did think there were some looks a little like mr <end> elton <end> 
emma restrained her indignation  and only turned from her in silence <end>

smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first
glancing towards miss fairfax  but it was most prudent to avoid speech <end>
he told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining room  
hated sitting long  was always the first to move when he could  
that his father  mr <end> knightley  mr <end> cox  and mr <end> cole  were left
very busy over parish business  that as long as he had staid 
however  it had been pleasant enough  as he had found them in general
a set of gentlemanlike  sensible men  and spoke so handsomely of
highbury altogether  thought it so abundant in agreeable families  
that emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place
rather too much <end>  she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire  
the extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe  and the sort 
and could make out from his answers that  as far as enscombe
was concerned  there was very little going on  that their visitings
were among a range of great families  none very near  and that even
when days were fixed  and invitations accepted  it was an even
chance that mrs <end> churchill were not in health and spirits for going 
that they made a point of visiting no fresh person  and that 
though he had his separate engagements  it was not without difficulty 
without considerable address  at   times   that he could get away 
or introduce an acquaintance for a night <end>

she saw that enscombe could not satisfy  and that highbury 
taken at its best  might reasonably please a young man who had more
retirement at home than he liked <end>  his importance at enscombe was
very evident <end>  he did not boast  but it naturally betrayed itself 
that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing 
and on her laughing and noticing it  he owned that he believed  excepting
one or two points  he could  with   time  persuade her to any thing <end>
one of those points on which his influence failed  he then mentioned <end>
he had wanted very much to go abroad  had been very eager indeed
to be allowed to travel  but she would not hear of it <end>  this had
happened the year before <end>   now   he said  he was beginning to have
no longer the same wish <end>

the unpersuadable point  which he did not mention  emma guessed
to be good behaviour to his father <end>

 i have made a most wretched discovery   said he  after a short pause <end>  
 i have been here a week to morrow  half my time <end>  i never knew
days fly so fast <end>  a week to morrow   and i have hardly begun to
enjoy myself <end>  but just got acquainted with mrs <end> weston  and others   
i hate the recollection <end> 

 perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day 
out of so few  in having your hair cut <end> 

 no   said he  smiling   that is no subject of regret at all <end>
i have no pleasure in seeing my friends  unless i can believe myself
fit to be seen <end> 

the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room  emma found herself
obliged to turn from him for a few minutes  and listen to mr <end> cole <end>
when mr <end> cole had moved away  and her attention could be restored
as before  she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room
at miss fairfax  who was sitting exactly opposite <end>

 what is the matter   said she <end>

he started <end>   thank you for rousing me   he replied <end>   i believe
i have been very rude  but really miss fairfax has done her hair
in so odd a way  so very odd a way  that i cannot keep my eyes
from her <end>  i never saw any thing so outree   those curls   this must
be a fancy of her own <end>  i see nobody else looking like her   
i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion <end>  shall i   
yes  i will  i declare i will  and you shall see how she takes it   
whether she colours <end> 

he was gone immediately  and emma soon saw him standing before miss
fairfax  and talking to her  but as to its effect on the young lady 
as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them  exactly
in front of miss fairfax  she could absolutely distinguish nothing <end>

before he could return to his chair  it was taken by mrs <end> weston <end>

 this is the luxury of a large party   said she    one can get
near every body  and say every thing <end>  my dear emma  i am longing
to talk to you <end>  i have been making discoveries and forming plans 
just like yourself  and i must tell them while the idea is fresh <end>
do you know how miss bates and her niece came here  

 how   they were invited  were not they  

 oh  yes  but how they were conveyed hither   the manner of their coming  

 they walked  i conclude <end>  how else could they come  

 very true <end>  well  a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad
it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again  late at night 
and cold as the nights are now <end>  and as i looked at her  though i
never saw her appear to more advantage  it struck me that she
was heated  and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold <end>
poor girl   i could not bear the idea of it  so  as soon as mr <end> weston
came into the room  and i could get at him  i spoke to him about
the carriage <end>  you may guess how readily he came into my wishes 
and having his approbation  i made my way directly to miss bates 
to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took
us home  for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once <end>
good soul  she was as grateful as possible  you may be sure <end>
 nobody was ever so fortunate as herself    but with many 
many thanks   there was no occasion to trouble us  for mr <end> knightley s
carriage had brought  and was to take them home again <end>   i was
quite surprized   very glad  i am sure  but really quite surprized <end>
such a very kind attention  and so thoughtful an attention   
the sort of thing that so few men would think of <end>  and  in short 
from knowing his usual ways  i am very much inclined to think
that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all <end>
i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself 
and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them <end> 

 very likely   said emma   nothing more likely <end>  i know no man
more likely than mr <end> knightley to do the sort of thing  to do any
thing really good natured  useful  considerate  or benevolent <end>
he is not a gallant man  but he is a very humane one  and this 
considering jane fairfax s ill health  would appear a case
of humanity to him   and for an act of unostentatious kindness 
there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr <end> knightley <end>
i know he had horses to day  for we arrived together  and i laughed at
him about it  but he said not a word that could betray <end> 

 well   said mrs <end> weston  smiling   you give him credit for
more simple  disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do 
for while miss bates was speaking  a suspicion darted into my head 
and i have never been able to get it out again <end>  the more i think
of it  the more probable it appears <end>  in short  i have made a match
between mr <end> knightley and jane fairfax <end>  see the consequence
of keeping you company   what do you say to it  

 mr <end> knightley and jane fairfax   exclaimed emma <end>   dear mrs <end> weston 
how could you think of such a thing   mr <end> knightley   mr <end> knightley
must not marry   you would not have little henry cut out from donwell   
oh  no  no  henry must have donwell <end>  i cannot at all consent to
mr <end> knightley s marrying  and i am sure it is not at all likely <end>
i am amazed that you should think of such a thing <end> 

 my dear emma  i have told you what led me to think of it <end>
i do not want the match  i do not want to injure dear little henry  
but the idea has been given me by circumstances  and if mr <end> knightley
really wished to marry  you would not have him refrain on henry s
account  a boy of six years old  who knows nothing of the matter  

 yes  i would <end>  i could not bear to have henry supplanted <end>  
mr <end> knightley marry   no  i have never had such an idea  and i
cannot adopt it now <end>  and jane fairfax  too  of all women  

 nay  she has always been a first favourite with him  as you
very well know <end> 

 but the imprudence of such a match  

 i am not speaking of its prudence  merely its probability <end> 

 i see no probability in it  unless you have any better foundation
than what you mention <end>  his good nature  his humanity  as i tell you 
would be quite enough to account for the horses <end>  he has a great
regard for the bateses  you know  independent of jane fairfax  
and is always glad to shew them attention <end>  my dear mrs <end> weston 
do not take to match making <end>  you do it very ill <end>  jane fairfax mistress
of the abbey   oh  no  no   every feeling revolts <end>  for his own sake 
i would not have him do so mad a thing <end> 

 imprudent  if you please  but not mad <end>  excepting inequality of fortune 
and perhaps a little disparity of age  i can see nothing unsuitable <end> 

 but mr <end> knightley does not want to marry <end>  i am sure he has not the
least idea of it <end>  do not put it into his head <end>  why should he marry   
he is as happy as possible by himself  with his farm  and his sheep 
and his library  and all the parish to manage  and he is extremely
fond of his brother s children <end>  he has no occasion to marry 
either to fill up his time or his heart <end> 

 my dear emma  as long as he thinks so  it is so  but if he really
loves jane fairfax   

 nonsense   he does not care about jane fairfax <end>  in the way
of love  i am sure he does not <end>  he would do any good to her 
or her family  but   

 well   said mrs <end> weston  laughing   perhaps the greatest good he
could do them  would be to give jane such a respectable home <end> 

 if it would be good to her  i am sure it would be evil to himself 
a very shameful and degrading connexion <end>  how would he bear to have
miss bates belonging to him   to have her haunting the abbey 
and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane   
 so very kind and obliging   but he always had been such a very
kind neighbour    and then fly off  through half a sentence 
to her mother s old petticoat <end>   not that it was such a very old
petticoat either  for still it would last a great while  and  indeed 
she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong <end>  

 for shame  emma   do not mimic her <end>  you divert me against
my conscience <end>  and  upon my word  i do not think mr <end> knightley would
be much disturbed by miss bates <end>  little things do not irritate him <end>
she might talk on  and if he wanted to say any thing himself  he would
only talk louder  and drown her voice <end>  but the question is not 
whether it would be a bad connexion for him  but whether he wishes it 
and i think he does <end>  i have heard him speak  and so must you 
so very highly of jane fairfax   the interest he takes in her  
his anxiety about her health  his concern that she should have no
happier prospect   i have heard him express himself so warmly on
those points   such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte 
and of her voice   i have heard him say that he could listen to her
for ever <end>  oh  and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred
to me  this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody  
though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present
from the campbells  may it not be from mr <end> knightley   i cannot
help suspecting him <end>  i think he is just the person to do it 
even without being in love <end> 

 then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love <end>
but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do <end>
mr <end> knightley does nothing mysteriously <end> 

 i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly 
oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would  in the common
course of things  occur to him <end> 

 very well  and if he had intended to give her one  he would have
told her so <end> 

 there might be scruples of delicacy  my dear emma <end>  i have a very
strong notion that it comes from him <end>  i am sure he was particularly
silent when mrs <end> cole told us of it at dinner <end> 

 you take up an idea  mrs <end> weston  and run away with it  as you have
many a time reproached me with doing <end>  i see no sign of attachment  
i believe nothing of the pianoforte  and proof only shall convince
me that mr <end> knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax <end> 

they combated the point some time longer in the same way  emma rather
gaining ground over the mind of her friend  for mrs <end> weston was
the most used of the two to yield  till a little bustle in the room
shewed them that tea was over  and the instrument in preparation   
and at the same moment mr <end> cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse
would do them the honour of trying it <end>  frank churchill  of whom 
in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs <end> weston  she had been
seeing nothing  except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax 
followed mr <end> cole  to add his very pressing entreaties  and as 
in every respect  it suited emma best to lead  she gave a very
proper compliance <end>

she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt
more than she could perform with credit  she wanted neither taste
nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable 
and could accompany her own voice well <end>  one accompaniment to her song
took her agreeably by surprize  a second  slightly but correctly
taken by frank churchill <end>  her pardon was duly begged at the close
of the song  and every thing usual followed <end>  he was accused
of having a delightful voice  and a perfect knowledge of music 
which was properly denied  and that he knew nothing of the matter 
and had no voice at all  roundly asserted <end>  they sang together
once more  and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax 
whose performance  both vocal and instrumental  she never could
attempt to conceal from herself  was infinitely superior to her own <end>

with mixed feelings  she seated herself at a little distance from the
numbers round the instrument  to listen <end>  frank churchill sang again <end>
they had sung together once or twice  it appeared  at weymouth <end>
but the sight of mr <end> knightley among the most attentive  soon drew
away half emma s mind  and she fell into a train of thinking
on the subject of mrs <end> weston s suspicions  to which the sweet
sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions <end>
her objections to mr <end> knightley s marrying did not in the least subside <end>
she could see nothing but evil in it <end>  it would be a great
disappointment to mr <end> john knightley  consequently to isabella <end>
a real injury to the children  a most mortifying change 
and material loss to them all   a very great deduction from her
father s daily comfort  and  as to herself  she could not at all
endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey <end>  a mrs <end> knightley
for them all to give way to   no  mr <end> knightley must never marry <end>
little henry must remain the heir of donwell <end>

presently mr <end> knightley looked back  and came and sat down by her <end>
they talked at first only of the performance <end>  his admiration
was certainly very warm  yet she thought  but for mrs <end> weston 
it would not have struck her <end>  as a sort of touchstone  however 
she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece 
and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short 
she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any
kindness of his own <end>

 i often feel concern   said she   that i dare not make our carriage
more useful on such occasions <end>  it is not that i am without the wish 
but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james
should put to for such a purpose <end> 

 quite out of the question  quite out of the question   he replied   
 but you must often wish it  i am sure <end>   and he smiled with such
seeming pleasure at the conviction  that she must proceed another step <end>

 this present from the campbells   said she   this pianoforte
is very kindly given <end> 

 yes   he replied  and without the smallest apparent embarrassment <end>  
 but they would have done better had they given her notice of it <end>
surprizes are foolish things <end>  the pleasure is not enhanced  and the
inconvenience is often considerable <end>  i should have expected better
judgment in colonel campbell <end> 

from that moment  emma could have taken her oath that mr <end> knightley
had had no concern in giving the instrument <end>  but whether he
were entirely free from peculiar attachment  whether there
were no actual preference  remained a little longer doubtful <end>
towards the end of jane s second song  her voice grew thick <end>

 that will do   said he  when it was finished  thinking aloud  
 you have sung quite enough for one evening  now be quiet <end> 

another song  however  was soon begged for <end>   one more   they would
not fatigue miss fairfax on any account  and would only ask for
one more <end>   and frank churchill was heard to say   i think you could
manage this without effort  the first part is so very trifling <end>
the strength of the song falls on the second <end> 

mr <end> knightley grew angry <end>

 that fellow   said he  indignantly   thinks of nothing but shewing
off his own voice <end>  this must not be <end>   and touching miss bates 
who at that moment passed near   miss bates  are you mad  to let
your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner   go  and interfere <end>
they have no mercy on her <end> 

miss bates  in her real anxiety for jane  could hardly stay even
to be grateful  before she stept forward and put an end to all
farther singing <end>  here ceased the concert part of the evening 
for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers 
but soon  within five minutes  the proposal of dancing  
originating nobody exactly knew where  was so effectually promoted
by mr <end> and mrs <end> cole  that every thing was rapidly clearing away 
to give proper space <end>  mrs <end> weston  capital in her country dances 
was seated  and beginning an irresistible waltz  and frank churchill 
coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma  had secured her hand 
and led her up to the top <end>

while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off 
emma found time  in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her
voice and her taste  to look about  and see what became of mr <end> knightley <end>
this would be a trial <end>  he was no dancer in general <end>  if he were to be
very alert in engaging jane fairfax now  it might augur something <end>
there was no immediate appearance <end>  no  he was talking to mrs <end> cole  
he was looking on unconcerned  jane was asked by somebody else 
and he was still talking to mrs <end> cole <end>

emma had no longer an alarm for henry  his interest was yet safe 
and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment <end>
not more than five couple could be mustered  but the rarity and the
suddenness of it made it very delightful  and she found herself well
matched in a partner <end>  they were a couple worth looking at <end>

two dances  unfortunately  were all that could be allowed <end>
it was growing late  and miss bates became anxious to get home 
on her mother s account <end>  after some attempts  therefore  to be
permitted to begin again  they were obliged to thank mrs <end> weston 
look sorrowful  and have done <end>

 perhaps it is as well   said frank churchill  as he attended emma
to her carriage <end>   i must have asked miss fairfax  and her languid
dancing would not have agreed with me  after your s <end> 



chapter ix


emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles <end>
the visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day 
and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side
of dignified seclusion  must be amply repaid in the splendour
of popularity <end>  she must have delighted the coles  worthy people 
who deserved to be made happy   and left a name behind her that would
not soon die away <end>

perfect happiness  even in memory  is not common  and there were
two points on which she was not quite easy <end>  she doubted whether
she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman  in betraying
her suspicions of jane fairfax s feelings to frank churchill <end>
it was hardly right  but it had been so strong an idea  that it
would escape her  and his submission to all that she told 
was a compliment to her penetration  which made it difficult
for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue <end>

the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax 
and there she had no doubt <end>  she did unfeignedly and unequivocally
regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing <end>  she did
most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood  and sat
down and practised vigorously an hour and a half <end>

she was then interrupted by harriet s coming in  and if harriet s
praise could have satisfied her  she might soon have been comforted <end>

 oh  if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax  

 don t class us together  harriet <end>  my playing is no more like
her s  than a lamp is like sunshine <end> 

 oh  dear  i think you play the best of the two <end>  i think you play
quite as well as she does <end>  i am sure i had much rather hear you <end>
every body last night said how well you played <end> 

 those who knew any thing about it  must have felt the difference <end>
the truth is  harriet  that my playing is just good enough to be praised 
but jane fairfax s is much beyond it <end> 

 well  i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does 
or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out <end>
mr <end> cole said how much taste you had  and mr <end> frank churchill talked
a great deal about your taste  and that he valued taste much more
than execution <end> 

 ah  but jane fairfax has them both  harriet <end> 

 are you sure   i saw she had execution  but i did not know she had
any taste <end>  nobody talked about it <end>  and i hate italian singing <end>  
there is no understanding a word of it <end>  besides  if she does play
so very well  you know  it is no more than she is obliged to do 
because she will have to teach <end>  the coxes were wondering last night
whether she would get into any great family <end>  how did you think the
coxes looked  

 just as they always do  very vulgar <end> 

 they told me something   said harriet rather hesitatingly 
 but it is nothing of any consequence <end> 

emma was obliged to ask what they had told her  though fearful
of its producing mr <end> elton <end>

 they told me  that mr <end> martin dined with them last saturday <end> 

 oh  

 he came to their father upon some business  and he asked him
to stay to dinner <end> 

 oh  

 they talked a great deal about him  especially anne cox <end>
i do not know what she meant  but she asked me if i thought i
should go and stay there again next summer <end> 

 she meant to be impertinently curious  just as such an anne cox
should be <end> 

 she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there <end>  he sat
by her at dinner <end>  miss nash thinks either of the coxes would
be very glad to marry him <end> 

 very likely <end>  i think they are  without exception  the most vulgar
girls in highbury <end> 

harriet had business at ford s <end>  emma thought it most prudent to go
with her <end>  another accidental meeting with the martins was possible 
and in her present state  would be dangerous <end>

harriet  tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word  was always
very long at a purchase  and while she was still hanging over muslins
and changing her mind  emma went to the door for amusement <end>  much could
not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury   
mr <end> perry walking hastily by  mr <end> william cox letting himself in at
the office door  mr <end> cole s carriage horses returning from exercise 
or a stray letter boy on an obstinate mule  were the liveliest
objects she could presume to expect  and when her eyes fell only on
the butcher with his tray  a tidy old woman travelling homewards from
shop with her full basket  two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone 
and a string of dawdling children round the baker s little bow window
eyeing the gingerbread  she knew she had no reason to complain 
and was amused enough  quite enough still to stand at the door <end>
a mind lively and at ease  can do with seeing nothing  and can see
nothing that does not answer <end>

she looked down the randalls road <end>  the scene enlarged 
two persons appeared  mrs <end> weston and her son in law  they were
walking into highbury   to hartfield of course <end>  they were stopping 
however  in the first place at mrs <end> bates s  whose house was
a little nearer randalls than ford s  and had all but knocked 
when emma caught their eye <end>  immediately they crossed the road
and came forward to her  and the agreeableness of yesterday s
engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting <end>
mrs <end> weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses 
in order to hear the new instrument <end>

 for my companion tells me   said she   that i absolutely promised
miss bates last night  that i would come this morning <end>  i was
not aware of it myself <end>  i did not know that i had fixed a day 
but as he says i did  i am going now <end> 

 and while mrs <end> weston pays her visit  i may be allowed  i hope  
said frank churchill   to join your party and wait for her at hartfield  
if you are going home <end> 

mrs <end> weston was disappointed <end>

 i thought you meant to go with me <end>  they would be very much pleased <end> 

 me   i should be quite in the way <end>  but  perhaps  i may be equally
in the way here <end>  miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me <end>
my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping <end>  she says i fidget
her to death  and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say
the same <end>  what am i to do  

 i am here on no business of my own   said emma   i am only waiting
for my friend <end>  she will probably have soon done  and then we
shall go home <end>  but you had better go with mrs <end> weston and hear
the instrument <end> 

 well  if you advise it <end>  but  with a smile  if colonel campbell
should have employed a careless friend  and if it should prove
to have an indifferent tone  what shall i say   i shall be no
support to mrs <end> weston <end>  she might do very well by herself <end>
a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips  but i
am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood <end> 

 i do not believe any such thing   replied emma <end>   i am persuaded
that you can be as insincere as your neighbours  when it is necessary 
but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent <end>
quite otherwise indeed  if i understood miss fairfax s opinion
last night <end> 

 do come with me   said mrs <end> weston   if it be not very disagreeable
to you <end>  it need not detain us long <end>  we will go to hartfield afterwards <end>
we will follow them to hartfield <end>  i really wish you to call with me <end>
it will be felt so great an attention  and i always thought you
meant it <end> 

he could say no more  and with the hope of hartfield to reward him 
returned with mrs <end> weston to mrs <end> bates s door <end>  emma watched them in 
and then joined harriet at the interesting counter   trying  with all
the force of her own mind  to convince her that if she wanted plain
muslin it was of no use to look at figured  and that a blue ribbon 
be it ever so beautiful  would still never match her yellow pattern <end>
at last it was all settled  even to the destination of the parcel <end>

 should i send it to mrs <end> goddard s  ma am   asked mrs <end> ford <end>  
 yes  no  yes  to mrs <end> goddard s <end> only my pattern gown is
at hartfield <end>  no  you shall send it to hartfield  if you please <end>
but then  mrs <end> goddard will want to see it <end>  and i could take the
pattern gown home any day <end>  but i shall want the ribbon directly  
so it had better go to hartfield  at least the ribbon <end>  you could
make it into two parcels  mrs <end> ford  could not you  

 it is not worth while  harriet  to give mrs <end> ford the trouble
of two parcels <end> 

 no more it is <end> 

 no trouble in the world  ma am   said the obliging mrs <end> ford <end>

 oh  but indeed i would much rather have it only in one <end>
then  if you please  you shall send it all to mrs <end> goddard s  
i do not know  no  i think  miss woodhouse  i may just as well
have it sent to hartfield  and take it home with me at night <end>
what do you advise  

 that you do not give another half second to the subject <end>
to hartfield  if you please  mrs <end> ford <end> 

 aye  that will be much best   said harriet  quite satisfied 
 i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs <end> goddard s <end> 

voices approached the shop  or rather one voice and two ladies 
mrs <end> weston and miss bates met them at the door <end>

 my dear miss woodhouse   said the latter   i am just run across to
entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while 
and give us your opinion of our new instrument  you and miss smith <end>
how do you do  miss smith   very well i thank you <end>  and i begged
mrs <end> weston to come with me  that i might be sure of succeeding <end> 

 i hope mrs <end> bates and miss fairfax are   

 very well  i am much obliged to you <end>  my mother is delightfully well 
and jane caught no cold last night <end>  how is mr <end> woodhouse   i am so glad
to hear such a good account <end>  mrs <end> weston told me you were here <end>  
oh  then  said i  i must run across  i am sure miss woodhouse will
allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in  my mother
will be so very happy to see her  and now we are such a nice party 
she cannot refuse <end>   aye  pray do   said mr <end> frank churchill 
 miss woodhouse s opinion of the instrument will be worth having <end>   
but  said i  i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go
with me <end>   oh   said he   wait half a minute  till i have finished
my job    for  would you believe it  miss woodhouse  there he is 
in the most obliging manner in the world  fastening in the rivet of my
mother s spectacles <end>  the rivet came out  you know  this morning <end>  
so very obliging   for my mother had no use of her spectacles  
could not put them on <end>  and  by the bye  every body ought to have
two pair of spectacles  they should indeed <end>  jane said so <end>
i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did 
but something or other hindered me all the morning  first one thing 
then another  there is no saying what  you know <end>  at one time patty came
to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping <end>  oh  said i 
patty do not come with your bad news to me <end>  here is the rivet
of your mistress s spectacles out <end>  then the baked apples came home 
mrs <end> wallis sent them by her boy  they are extremely civil and
obliging to us  the wallises  always  i have heard some people
say that mrs <end> wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer 
but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention
from them <end>  and it cannot be for the value of our custom now 
for what is our consumption of bread  you know   only three of us <end>  
besides dear jane at present  and she really eats nothing  makes such
a shocking breakfast  you would be quite frightened if you saw it <end>
i dare not let my mother know how little she eats  so i say one
thing and then i say another  and it passes off <end>  but about the
middle of the day she gets hungry  and there is nothing she likes
so well as these baked apples  and they are extremely wholesome 
for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr <end> perry 
i happened to meet him in the street <end>  not that i had any doubt before  
i have so often heard mr <end> woodhouse recommend a baked apple <end>
i believe it is the only way that mr <end> woodhouse thinks the
fruit thoroughly wholesome <end>  we have apple dumplings  however 
very often <end>  patty makes an excellent apple dumpling <end> well 
mrs <end> weston  you have prevailed  i hope  and these ladies will
oblige us <end> 

emma would be  very happy to wait on mrs <end> bates   c <end>   and they
did at last move out of the shop  with no farther delay from miss
bates than 

 how do you do  mrs <end> ford   i beg your pardon <end>  i did not see
you before <end>  i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons
from town <end>  jane came back delighted yesterday <end>  thank ye 
the gloves do very well  only a little too large about the wrist 
but jane is taking them in <end> 

 what was i talking of   said she  beginning again when they were
all in the street <end>

emma wondered on what  of all the medley  she would fix <end>

 i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of <end>  oh  my
mother s spectacles <end>  so very obliging of mr <end> frank churchill 
 oh   said he   i do think i can fasten the rivet  i like a job
of this kind excessively <end>   which you know shewed him to be so
very <end>  <end>  <end>  <end> indeed i must say that  much as i had heard of him
before and much as i had expected  he very far exceeds any
thing <end>  <end>  <end>  <end> i do congratulate you  mrs <end> weston  most warmly <end>
he seems every thing the fondest parent could <end>  <end>  <end>  <end>  oh   said he 
 i can fasten the rivet <end>  i like a job of that sort excessively <end> 
i never shall forget his manner <end>  and when i brought out the baked
apples from the closet  and hoped our friends would be so very
obliging as to take some   oh   said he directly   there is nothing
in the way of fruit half so good  and these are the finest looking
home baked apples i ever saw in my life <end>   that  you know  was so
very <end>  <end>  <end>  <end> and i am sure  by his manner  it was no compliment <end>
indeed they are very delightful apples  and mrs <end> wallis does them
full justice  only we do not have them baked more than twice 
and mr <end> woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times  
but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it <end>  the apples
themselves are the very finest sort for baking  beyond a doubt 
all from donwell  some of mr <end> knightley s most liberal supply <end>
he sends us a sack every year  and certainly there never was such
a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees  i believe there
is two of them <end>  my mother says the orchard was always famous
in her younger days <end>  but i was really quite shocked the other day  
for mr <end> knightley called one morning  and jane was eating these apples 
and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them 
and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock <end>
 i am sure you must be   said he   and i will send you
another supply  for i have a great many more than i can ever use <end>
william larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year <end>
i will send you some more  before they get good for nothing <end> 
so i begged he would not  for really as to ours being gone  i could
not absolutely say that we had a great many left  it was but half
a dozen indeed  but they should be all kept for jane  and i could
not at all bear that he should be sending us more  so liberal as he
had been already  and jane said the same <end>  and when he was gone 
she almost quarrelled with me  no  i should not say quarrelled 
for we never had a quarrel in our lives  but she was quite distressed
that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone  she wished i had
made him believe we had a great many left <end>  oh  said i  my dear 
i did say as much as i could <end>  however  the very same evening
william larkins came over with a large basket of apples  the same
sort of apples  a bushel at least  and i was very much obliged 
and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing 
as you may suppose <end>  william larkins is such an old acquaintance 
i am always glad to see him <end>  but  however  i found afterwards
from patty  that william said it was all the apples of  that  sort
his master had  he had brought them all  and now his master had not
one left to bake or boil <end>  william did not seem to mind it himself 
he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many  for william 
you know  thinks more of his master s profit than any thing 
but mrs <end> hodges  he said  was quite displeased at their being
all sent away <end>  she could not bear that her master should not be
able to have another apple tart this spring <end>  he told patty this 
but bid her not mind it  and be sure not to say any thing to us
about it  for mrs <end> hodges  would  be cross sometimes  and as long as
so many sacks were sold  it did not signify who ate the remainder <end>
and so patty told me  and i was excessively shocked indeed 
i would not have mr <end> knightley know any thing about it for
the world   he would be so very <end>  <end>  <end>  <end> i wanted to keep it from
jane s knowledge  but  unluckily  i had mentioned it before i was
aware <end> 

miss bates had just done as patty opened the door  and her visitors
walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to 
pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good will <end>

 pray take care  mrs <end> weston  there is a step at the turning <end>
pray take care  miss woodhouse  ours is rather a dark staircase  
rather darker and narrower than one could wish <end>  miss smith 
pray take care <end>  miss woodhouse  i am quite concerned  i am sure you
hit your foot <end>  miss smith  the step at the turning <end> 



chapter x


the appearance of the little sitting room as they entered 
was tranquillity itself  mrs <end> bates  deprived of her usual employment 
slumbering on one side of the fire  frank churchill  at a table
near her  most deedily occupied about her spectacles  and jane fairfax 
standing with her back to them  intent on her pianoforte <end>

busy as he was  however  the young man was yet able to shew a most
happy countenance on seeing emma again <end>

 this is a pleasure   said he  in rather a low voice   coming at
least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated <end>  you find me
trying to be useful  tell me if you think i shall succeed <end> 

 what   said mrs <end> weston   have not you finished it yet  you would
not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate <end> 

 i have not been working uninterruptedly   he replied   i have been
assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily 
it was not quite firm  an unevenness in the floor  i believe <end>
you see we have been wedging one leg with paper <end>  this was very kind
of you to be persuaded to come <end>  i was almost afraid you would be
hurrying home <end> 

he contrived that she should be seated by him  and was sufficiently
employed in looking out the best baked apple for her  and trying
to make her help or advise him in his work  till jane fairfax was
quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again <end>  that she was not
immediately ready  emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves 
she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it
without emotion  she must reason herself into the power of performance 
and emma could not but pity such feelings  whatever their origin 
and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again <end>

at last jane began  and though the first bars were feebly given 
the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to <end>
mrs <end> weston had been delighted before  and was delighted again 
emma joined her in all her praise  and the pianoforte  with every
proper discrimination  was pronounced to be altogether of the
highest promise <end>

 whoever colonel campbell might employ   said frank churchill 
with a smile at emma   the person has not chosen ill <end>  i heard a good
deal of colonel campbell s taste at weymouth  and the softness of the
upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and  all   that   party  would
particularly prize <end>  i dare say  miss fairfax  that he either gave
his friend very minute directions  or wrote to broadwood himself <end>
do not you think so  

jane did not look round <end>  she was not obliged to hear <end>  mrs <end> weston
had been speaking to her at the same moment <end>

 it is not fair   said emma  in a whisper   mine was a random guess <end>
do not distress her <end> 

he shook his head with a smile  and looked as if he had very little
doubt and very little mercy <end>  soon afterwards he began again 

 how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure
on this occasion  miss fairfax <end>  i dare say they often think of you 
and wonder which will be the day  the precise day of the instrument s
coming to hand <end>  do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business
to be going forward just at this time   do you imagine it to be
the consequence of an immediate commission from him  or that he may
have sent only a general direction  an order indefinite as to time 
to depend upon contingencies and conveniences  

he paused <end>  she could not but hear  she could not avoid answering 

 till i have a letter from colonel campbell   said she  in a voice
of forced calmness   i can imagine nothing with any confidence <end>
it must be all conjecture <end> 

 conjecture  aye  sometimes one conjectures right  and sometimes
one conjectures wrong <end>  i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall
make this rivet quite firm <end>  what nonsense one talks  miss woodhouse 
when hard at work  if one talks at all   your real workmen 
i suppose  hold their tongues  but we gentlemen labourers if we get
hold of a word  miss fairfax said something about conjecturing <end>
there  it is done <end>  i have the pleasure  madam   to mrs <end> bates  
of restoring your spectacles  healed for the present <end> 

he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter  to escape
a little from the latter  he went to the pianoforte  and begged
miss fairfax  who was still sitting at it  to play something more <end>

 if you are very kind   said he   it will be one of the waltzes
we danced last night   let me live them over again <end>  you did not
enjoy them as i did  you appeared tired the whole time <end>  i believe
you were glad we danced no longer  but i would have given worlds  
all the worlds one ever has to give  for another half hour <end> 

she played <end>

 what felicity it is to hear a tune again which  has  made one happy   
if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth <end> 

she looked up at him for a moment  coloured deeply  and played
something else <end>  he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte 
and turning to emma  said 

 here is something quite new to me <end>  do you know it   cramer <end>  
and here are a new set of irish melodies <end>  that  from such a quarter 
one might expect <end>  this was all sent with the instrument <end>  very thoughtful
of colonel campbell  was not it   he knew miss fairfax could have
no music here <end>  i honour that part of the attention particularly 
it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart <end>  nothing hastily
done  nothing incomplete <end>  true affection only could have prompted it <end> 

emma wished he would be less pointed  yet could not help being amused 
and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught
the remains of a smile  when she saw that with all the deep blush
of consciousness  there had been a smile of secret delight 
she had less scruple in the amusement  and much less compunction
with respect to her <end>  this amiable  upright  perfect jane fairfax
was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings <end>

he brought all the music to her  and they looked it over together <end>  
emma took the opportunity of whispering 

 you speak too plain <end>  she must understand you <end> 

 i hope she does <end>  i would have her understand me <end>  i am not
in the least ashamed of my meaning <end> 

 but really  i am half ashamed  and wish i had never taken up
the idea <end> 

 i am very glad you did  and that you communicated it to me <end>
i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways <end>  leave shame to her <end>
if she does wrong  she ought to feel it <end> 

 she is not entirely without it  i think <end> 

 i do not see much sign of it <end>  she is playing  robin   adair 
at this moment   his  favourite <end> 

shortly afterwards miss bates  passing near the window 
descried mr <end> knightley on horse back not far off <end>

 mr <end> knightley i declare   i must speak to him if possible 
just to thank him <end>  i will not open the window here  it would give
you all cold  but i can go into my mother s room you know <end>  i dare
say he will come in when he knows who is here <end>  quite delightful
to have you all meet so   our little room so honoured  

she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke  and opening
the casement there  immediately called mr <end> knightley s attention 
and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard
by the others  as if it had passed within the same apartment <end>

 how d  ye do   how d ye do   very well  i thank you <end>  so obliged
to you for the carriage last night <end>  we were just in time 
my mother just ready for us <end>  pray come in  do come in <end>  you will
find some friends here <end> 

so began miss bates  and mr <end> knightley seemed determined to be heard
in his turn  for most resolutely and commandingly did he say 

 how is your niece  miss bates   i want to inquire after you all 
but particularly your niece <end>  how is miss fairfax   i hope she
caught no cold last night <end>  how is she to day  tell me how miss
fairfax is <end> 

and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he
would hear her in any thing else <end>  the listeners were amused 
and mrs <end> weston gave emma a look of particular meaning <end>  but emma
still shook her head in steady scepticism <end>

 so obliged to you   so very much obliged to you for the carriage  
resumed miss bates <end>

he cut her short with 

 i am going to kingston <end>  can i do any thing for you  

 oh  dear  kingston  are you   mrs <end> cole was saying the other day
she wanted something from kingston <end> 

 mrs <end> cole has servants to send <end>  can i do any thing for  you   

 no  i thank you <end>  but do come in <end>  who do you think is here   
miss woodhouse and miss smith  so kind as to call to hear the
new pianoforte <end>  do put up your horse at the crown  and come in <end> 

 well   said he  in a deliberating manner   for five minutes  perhaps <end> 

 and here is mrs <end> weston and mr <end> frank churchill too   quite delightful 
so many friends  

 no  not now  i thank you <end>  i could not stay two minutes <end>
i must get on to kingston as fast as i can <end> 

 oh  do come in <end>  they will be so very happy to see you <end> 

 no  no  your room is full enough <end>  i will call another day 
and hear the pianoforte <end> 

 well  i am so sorry   oh   mr <end> knightley  what a delightful party
last night  how extremely pleasant <end>  did you ever see such dancing   
was not it delightful   miss woodhouse and mr <end> frank churchill 
i never saw any thing equal to it <end> 

 oh  very delightful indeed  i can say nothing less  for i suppose
miss woodhouse and mr <end> frank churchill are hearing every thing
that passes <end>  and  raising his voice still more  i do not see why miss
fairfax should not be mentioned too <end>  i think miss fairfax dances
very well  and mrs <end> weston is the very best country dance player 
without exception  in england <end>  now  if your friends have any gratitude 
they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return 
but i cannot stay to hear it <end> 

 oh   mr <end> knightley  one moment more  something of consequence  
so shocked   jane and i are both so shocked about the apples  

 what is the matter now  

 to think of your sending us all your store apples <end>  you said you had
a great many  and now you have not one left <end>  we really are so shocked 
mrs <end> hodges may well be angry <end>  william larkins mentioned it here <end>
you should not have done it  indeed you should not <end>  ah  he is off <end>
he never can bear to be thanked <end>  but i thought he would have staid now 
and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned <end>  <end>  <end>  <end> well 
 returning to the room   i have not been able to succeed <end>
mr <end> knightley cannot stop <end>  he is going to kingston <end>  he asked me
if he could do any thing <end>  <end>  <end>  <end> 

 yes   said jane   we heard his kind offers  we heard every thing <end> 

 oh  yes  my dear  i dare say you might  because you know  the door
was open  and the window was open  and mr <end> knightley spoke loud <end>
you must have heard every thing to be sure <end>   can i do any thing
for you at kingston   said he  so i just mentioned <end>  <end>  <end>  <end> oh 
miss woodhouse  must you be going   you seem but just come  so very
obliging of you <end> 

emma found it really time to be at home  the visit had already
lasted long  and on examining watches  so much of the morning was
perceived to be gone  that mrs <end> weston and her companion taking
leave also  could allow themselves only to walk with the two young
ladies to hartfield gates  before they set off for randalls <end>



chapter xi


it may be possible to do without dancing entirely <end>  instances have
been known of young people passing many  many months successively 
without being at any ball of any description  and no material injury
accrue either to body or mind   but when a beginning is made  
when the felicities of rapid motion have once been  though slightly 
felt  it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more <end>

frank churchill had danced once at highbury  and longed to dance again 
and the last half hour of an evening which mr <end> woodhouse was persuaded
to spend with his daughter at randalls  was passed by the two young
people in schemes on the subject <end>  frank s was the first idea 
and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it  for the lady was the best
judge of the difficulties  and the most solicitous for accommodation
and appearance <end>  but still she had inclination enough for shewing
people again how delightfully mr <end> frank churchill and miss
woodhouse danced  for doing that in which she need not blush to compare
herself with jane fairfax  and even for simple dancing itself 
without any of the wicked aids of vanity  to assist him first
in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made
to hold  and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour 
in the hope of discovering  in spite of all that mr <end> weston could
say of their exactly equal size  that it was a little the largest <end>

his first proposition and request  that the dance begun at mr <end> cole s
should be finished there  that the same party should be collected 
and the same musician engaged  met with the readiest acquiescence <end>
mr <end> weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment 
and mrs <end> weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they
could wish to dance  and the interesting employment had followed 
of reckoning up exactly who there would be  and portioning out the
indispensable division of space to every couple <end>

 you and miss smith  and miss fairfax  will be three  and the two
miss coxes five   had been repeated many times over <end>   and there
will be the two gilberts  young cox  my father  and myself 
besides mr <end> knightley <end>  yes  that will be quite enough for pleasure <end>
you and miss smith  and miss fairfax  will be three  and the two miss
coxes five  and for five couple there will be plenty of room <end> 

but soon it came to be on one side 

 but will there be good room for five couple   i really do not think
there will <end> 

on another 

 and after all  five couple are not enough to make it worth
while to stand up <end>  five couple are nothing  when one thinks
seriously about it <end>  it will not do to  invite  five couple <end>
it can be allowable only as the thought of the moment <end> 

somebody said that  miss  gilbert was expected at her brother s 
and must be invited with the rest <end>  somebody else believed
 mrs  <end> gilbert would have danced the other evening  if she had
been asked <end>  a word was put in for a second young cox  and at last 
mr <end> weston naming one family of cousins who must be included 
and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out 
it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten 
and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they
could be disposed of <end>

the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other <end>
 might not they use both rooms  and dance across the passage  
it seemed the best scheme  and yet it was not so good but that
many of them wanted a better <end>  emma said it would be awkward 
mrs <end> weston was in distress about the supper  and mr <end> woodhouse
opposed it earnestly  on the score of health <end>  it made him so
very unhappy  indeed  that it could not be persevered in <end>

 oh  no   said he   it would be the extreme of imprudence <end>
i could not bear it for emma   emma is not strong <end>  she would
catch a dreadful cold <end>  so would poor little harriet <end>
so you would all <end>  mrs <end> weston  you would be quite laid up 
do not let them talk of such a wild thing <end>  pray do not let them
talk of it <end>  that young man  speaking lower  is very thoughtless <end>
do not tell his father  but that young man is not quite the thing <end>
he has been opening the doors very often this evening  and keeping
them open very inconsiderately <end>  he does not think of the draught <end>
i do not mean to set you against him  but indeed he is not quite
the thing  

mrs <end> weston was sorry for such a charge <end>  she knew the importance
of it  and said every thing in her power to do it away <end>  every door
was now closed  the passage plan given up  and the first scheme
of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again 
and with such good will on frank churchill s part  that the space
which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient
for five couple  was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough
for ten <end>

 we were too magnificent   said he <end>   we allowed unnecessary room <end>
ten couple may stand here very well <end> 

emma demurred <end>   it would be a crowd  a sad crowd  and what could
be worse than dancing without space to turn in  

 very true   he gravely replied   it was very bad <end>   but still he
went on measuring  and still he ended with 

 i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple <end> 

 no  no   said she   you are quite unreasonable <end>  it would be dreadful
to be standing so close   nothing can be farther from pleasure
than to be dancing in a crowd  and a crowd in a little room  

 there is no denying it   he replied <end>   i agree with you exactly <end>
a crowd in a little room  miss woodhouse  you have the art of giving
pictures in a few words <end>  exquisite  quite exquisite   still  however 
having proceeded so far  one is unwilling to give the matter up <end>
it would be a disappointment to my father  and altogether  i do
not know that  i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand
here very well <end> 

emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little
self willed  and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure
of dancing with her  but she took the compliment  and forgave
the rest <end>  had she intended ever to  marry  him  it might have been
worth while to pause and consider  and try to understand the value
of his preference  and the character of his temper  but for
all the purposes of their acquaintance  he was quite amiable enough <end>

before the middle of the next day  he was at hartfield  and he entered
the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance
of the scheme <end>  it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement <end>

 well  miss woodhouse   he almost immediately began   your inclination
for dancing has not been quite frightened away  i hope  by the
terrors of my father s little rooms <end>  i bring a new proposal
on the subject   a thought of my father s  which waits only your
approbation to be acted upon <end>  may i hope for the honour of your
hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball 
to be given  not at randalls  but at the crown inn  

 the crown  

 yes  if you and mr <end> woodhouse see no objection  and i trust you cannot 
my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there <end>
better accommodations  he can promise them  and not a less grateful
welcome than at randalls <end>  it is his own idea <end>  mrs <end> weston sees
no objection to it  provided you are satisfied <end>  this is what we
all feel <end>  oh  you were perfectly right   ten couple  in either of
the randalls rooms  would have been insufferable   dreadful   i felt
how right you were the whole time  but was too anxious for securing
 any   thing  to like to yield <end>  is not it a good exchange   you consent  
i hope you consent  

 it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to  if mr <end> and
mrs <end> weston do not <end>  i think it admirable  and  as far as i can
answer for myself  shall be most happy  it seems the only improvement
that could be <end>  papa  do you not think it an excellent improvement  

she was obliged to repeat and explain it  before it was fully
comprehended  and then  being quite new  farther representations
were necessary to make it acceptable <end>

 no  he thought it very far from an improvement  a very bad plan  
much worse than the other <end>  a room at an inn was always damp
and dangerous  never properly aired  or fit to be inhabited <end>
if they must dance  they had better dance at randalls <end>  he had never
been in the room at the crown in his life  did not know the people
who kept it by sight <end>  oh  no  a very bad plan <end>  they would catch
worse colds at the crown than anywhere <end> 

 i was going to observe  sir   said frank churchill 
 that one of the great recommendations of this change would
be the very little danger of any body s catching cold  
so much less danger at the crown than at randalls   mr <end> perry
might have reason to regret the alteration  but nobody else could <end> 

 sir   said mr <end> woodhouse  rather warmly   you are very much
mistaken if you suppose mr <end> perry to be that sort of character <end>
mr <end> perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill <end>  but i
do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you
than your father s house <end> 

 from the very circumstance of its being larger  sir <end>  we shall have
no occasion to open the windows at all  not once the whole evening 
and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows  letting in cold
air upon heated bodies  which  as you well know  sir  does the mischief <end> 

 open the windows   but surely  mr <end> churchill  nobody would think
of opening the windows at randalls <end>  nobody could be so imprudent 
i never heard of such a thing <end>  dancing with open windows   i am sure 
neither your father nor mrs <end> weston  poor miss taylor that was 
would suffer it <end> 

 ah  sir  but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind
a window curtain  and throw up a sash  without its being suspected <end>
i have often known it done myself <end> 

 have you indeed  sir   bless me   i never could have supposed it <end>
but i live out of the world  and am often astonished at what i hear <end>
however  this does make a difference  and  perhaps  when we come
to talk it over  but these sort of things require a good deal
of consideration <end>  one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry <end>
if mr <end> and mrs <end> weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning 
we may talk it over  and see what can be done <end> 

 but  unfortunately  sir  my time is so limited   

 oh   interrupted emma   there will be plenty of time for talking
every thing over <end>  there is no hurry at all <end>  if it can be contrived
to be at the crown  papa  it will be very convenient for the horses <end>
they will be so near their own stable <end> 

 so they will  my dear <end>  that is a great thing <end>  not that james
ever complains  but it is right to spare our horses when we can <end>
if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired  but is
mrs <end> stokes to be trusted   i doubt it <end>  i do not know her 
even by sight <end> 

 i can answer for every thing of that nature  sir  because it will
be under mrs <end> weston s care <end>  mrs <end> weston undertakes to direct
the whole <end> 

 there  papa   now you must be satisfied  our own dear mrs <end> weston 
who is carefulness itself <end>  do not you remember what mr <end> perry said 
so many years ago  when i had the measles    if  miss   taylor  undertakes
to wrap miss emma up  you need not have any fears  sir <end>   how often
have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her  

 aye  very true <end>  mr <end> perry did say so <end>  i shall never forget it <end>
poor little emma   you were very bad with the measles  that is 
you would have been very bad  but for perry s great attention <end>
he came four times a day for a week <end>  he said  from the first 
it was a very good sort  which was our great comfort  but the measles
are a dreadful complaint <end>  i hope whenever poor isabella s little ones
have the measles  she will send for perry <end> 

 my father and mrs <end> weston are at the crown at this moment  
said frank churchill   examining the capabilities of the house <end>
i left them there and came on to hartfield  impatient for your opinion 
and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice
on the spot <end>  i was desired to say so from both <end>  it would be the
greatest pleasure to them  if you could allow me to attend you there <end>
they can do nothing satisfactorily without you <end> 

emma was most happy to be called to such a council  and her father 
engaging to think it all over while she was gone  the two young
people set off together without delay for the crown <end>  there were
mr <end> and mrs <end> weston  delighted to see her and receive her approbation 
very busy and very happy in their different way  she  in some
little distress  and he  finding every thing perfect <end>

 emma   said she   this paper is worse than i expected <end>
look  in places you see it is dreadfully dirty  and the wainscot
is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined <end> 

 my dear  you are too particular   said her husband <end>   what does
all that signify   you will see nothing of it by candlelight <end>
it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight <end>  we never see any
thing of it on our club nights <end> 

the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant   men never
know when things are dirty or not   and the gentlemen perhaps
thought each to himself   women will have their little nonsenses
and needless cares <end> 

one perplexity  however  arose  which the gentlemen did not disdain <end>
it regarded a supper room <end>  at the time of the ballroom s being built 
suppers had not been in question  and a small card room adjoining 
was the only addition <end>  what was to be done   this card room would
be wanted as a card room now  or  if cards were conveniently voted
unnecessary by their four selves  still was it not too small for
any comfortable supper   another room of much better size might be
secured for the purpose  but it was at the other end of the house 
and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it <end>
this made a difficulty <end>  mrs <end> weston was afraid of draughts
for the young people in that passage  and neither emma nor the
gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded
at supper <end>

mrs <end> weston proposed having no regular supper  merely sandwiches 
 c <end>  set out in the little room  but that was scouted as a
wretched suggestion <end>  a private dance  without sitting down to supper 
was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women 
and mrs <end> weston must not speak of it again <end>  she then took another
line of expediency  and looking into the doubtful room  observed 

 i do not think it  is  so very small <end>  we shall not be many 
you know <end> 

and mr <end> weston at the same time  walking briskly with long steps
through the passage  was calling out 

 you talk a great deal of the length of this passage  my dear <end>
it is a mere nothing after all  and not the least draught from
the stairs <end> 

 i wish   said mrs <end> weston   one could know which arrangement our
guests in general would like best <end>  to do what would be most generally
pleasing must be our object  if one could but tell what that would be <end> 

 yes  very true   cried frank   very true <end>  you want your neighbours 
opinions <end>  i do not wonder at you <end>  if one could ascertain what the
chief of them  the coles  for instance <end>  they are not far off <end>
shall i call upon them   or miss bates   she is still nearer <end>  
and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand
the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body <end>  i think
we do want a larger council <end>  suppose i go and invite miss bates
to join us  

 well  if you please   said mrs <end> weston rather hesitating   if you
think she will be of any use <end> 

 you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates   said emma <end>
 she will be all delight and gratitude  but she will tell you nothing <end>
she will not even listen to your questions <end>  i see no advantage in
consulting miss bates <end> 

 but she is so amusing  so extremely amusing   i am very fond
of hearing miss bates talk <end>  and i need not bring the whole family 
you know <end> 

here mr <end> weston joined them  and on hearing what was proposed 
gave it his decided approbation <end>

 aye  do  frank <end>  go and fetch miss bates  and let us end the matter
at once <end>  she will enjoy the scheme  i am sure  and i do not know
a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties <end>
fetch miss bates <end>  we are growing a little too nice <end>  she is
a standing lesson of how to be happy <end>  but fetch them both <end>
invite them both <end> 

 both sir   can the old lady    <end>  <end>  <end>

 the old lady   no  the young lady  to be sure <end>  i shall think you
a great blockhead  frank  if you bring the aunt without the niece <end> 

 oh   i beg your pardon  sir <end>  i did not immediately recollect <end>
undoubtedly if you wish it  i will endeavour to persuade them both <end> 
and away he ran <end>

long before he reappeared  attending the short  neat  brisk moving aunt 
and her elegant niece   mrs <end> weston  like a sweet tempered
woman and a good wife  had examined the passage again 
and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before  
indeed very trifling  and here ended the difficulties of decision <end>
all the rest  in speculation at least  was perfectly smooth <end>
all the minor arrangements of table and chair  lights and music 
tea and supper  made themselves  or were left as mere trifles
to be settled at any time between mrs <end> weston and mrs <end> stokes <end>  
every body invited  was certainly to come  frank had already written
to enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight 
which could not possibly be refused <end>  and a delightful dance it was
to be <end>

most cordially  when miss bates arrived  did she agree that it must <end>
as a counsellor she was not wanted  but as an approver   a much
safer character   she was truly welcome <end>  her approbation  at once
general and minute  warm and incessant  could not but please 
and for another half hour they were all walking to and fro 
between the different rooms  some suggesting  some attending 
and all in happy enjoyment of the future <end>  the party did not break
up without emma s being positively secured for the two first dances
by the hero of the evening  nor without her overhearing mr <end> weston
whisper to his wife   he has asked her  my dear <end>  that s right <end>
i knew he would  



chapter xii


one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball
completely satisfactory to emma  its being fixed for a day within
the granted term of frank churchill s stay in surry  for  in spite
of mr <end> weston s confidence  she could not think it so very impossible
that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain
a day beyond his fortnight <end>  but this was not judged feasible <end>
the preparations must take their time  nothing could be properly
ready till the third week were entered on  and for a few days they
must be planning  proceeding and hoping in uncertainty  at the risk  
in her opinion  the great risk  of its being all in vain <end>

enscombe however was gracious  gracious in fact  if not in word <end>
his wish of staying longer evidently did not please  but it was
not opposed <end>  all was safe and prosperous  and as the removal of one
solicitude generally makes way for another  emma  being now certain
of her ball  began to adopt as the next vexation mr <end> knightley s
provoking indifference about it <end>  either because he did not
dance himself  or because the plan had been formed without his
being consulted  he seemed resolved that it should not interest him 
determined against its exciting any present curiosity  or affording
him any future amusement <end>  to her voluntary communications emma
could get no more approving reply  than 

 very well <end>  if the westons think it worth while to be at all this
trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment  i have nothing
to say against it  but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me <end>  
oh  yes  i must be there  i could not refuse  and i will keep
as much awake as i can  but i would rather be at home  looking over
william larkins s week s account  much rather  i confess <end>  
pleasure in seeing dancing   not i  indeed  i never look at it  
i do not know who does <end>  fine dancing  i believe  like virtue 
must be its own reward <end>  those who are standing by are usually
thinking of something very different <end> 

this emma felt was aimed at her  and it made her quite angry <end>
it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was
so indifferent  or so indignant  he was not guided by  her  feelings
in reprobating the ball  for  she  enjoyed the thought of it
to an extraordinary degree <end>  it made her animated  open hearted  
she voluntarily said   

 oh   miss woodhouse  i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball <end>
what a disappointment it would be   i do look forward to it  i own 
with  very  great pleasure <end> 

it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have
preferred the society of william larkins <end>  no   she was more and more
convinced that mrs <end> weston was quite mistaken in that surmise <end>
there was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment
on his side  but no love <end>

alas  there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr <end> knightley <end>
two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the
over throw of every thing <end>  a letter arrived from mr <end> churchill
to urge his nephew s instant return <end>  mrs <end> churchill was unwell  
far too unwell to do without him  she had been in a very suffering
state  so said her husband  when writing to her nephew two days before 
though from her usual unwillingness to give pain  and constant
habit of never thinking of herself  she had not mentioned it 
but now she was too ill to trifle  and must entreat him to set off
for enscombe without delay <end>

the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma  in a note
from mrs <end> weston  instantly <end>  as to his going  it was inevitable <end>
he must be gone within a few hours  though without feeling any real
alarm for his aunt  to lessen his repugnance <end>  he knew her illnesses 
they never occurred but for her own convenience <end>

mrs <end> weston added   that he could only allow himself time to
hurry to highbury  after breakfast  and take leave of the few
friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him 
and that he might be expected at hartfield very soon <end> 

this wretched note was the finale of emma s breakfast <end>  when once
it had been read  there was no doing any thing  but lament
and exclaim <end>  the loss of the ball  the loss of the young man  
and all that the young man might be feeling   it was too wretched   
such a delightful evening as it would have been   every body so happy 
and she and her partner the happiest    i said it would be so  
was the only consolation <end>

her father s feelings were quite distinct <end>  he thought principally
of mrs <end> churchill s illness  and wanted to know how she was treated 
and as for the ball  it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed 
but they would all be safer at home <end>

emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared 
but if this reflected at all upon his impatience  his sorrowful
look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him <end>
he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it <end>  his dejection
was most evident <end>  he sat really lost in thought for the first
few minutes  and when rousing himself  it was only to say 

 of all horrid things  leave taking is the worst <end> 

 but you will come again   said emma <end>   this will not be your only
visit to randalls <end> 

 ah    shaking his head   the uncertainty of when i may be able
to return   i shall try for it with a zeal   it will be the object
of all my thoughts and cares   and if my uncle and aunt go to town
this spring  but i am afraid  they did not stir last spring  
i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever <end> 

 our poor ball must be quite given up <end> 

 ah  that ball   why did we wait for any thing   why not seize the
pleasure at once   how often is happiness destroyed by preparation 
foolish preparation   you told us it would be so <end>  oh   miss woodhouse 
why are you always so right  

 indeed  i am very sorry to be right in this instance <end>  i would
much rather have been merry than wise <end> 

 if i can come again  we are still to have our ball <end>  my father
depends on it <end>  do not forget your engagement <end> 

emma looked graciously <end>

 such a fortnight as it has been   he continued   every day more
precious and more delightful than the day before   every day making
me less fit to bear any other place <end>  happy those  who can remain
at highbury  

 as you do us such ample justice now   said emma  laughing   i will
venture to ask  whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first 
do not we rather surpass your expectations   i am sure we do <end>
i am sure you did not much expect to like us <end>  you would not have been
so long in coming  if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury <end> 

he laughed rather consciously  and though denying the sentiment 
emma was convinced that it had been so <end>

 and you must be off this very morning  

 yes  my father is to join me here   we shall walk back together 
and i must be off immediately <end>  i am almost afraid that every moment
will bring him <end> 

 not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and
miss bates   how unlucky   miss bates s powerful  argumentative mind
might have strengthened yours <end> 

 yes  i  have  called there  passing the door  i thought it better <end>
it was a right thing to do <end>  i went in for three minutes  and was
detained by miss bates s being absent <end>  she was out  and i felt it
impossible not to wait till she came in <end>  she is a woman that one may 
that one  must  laugh at  but that one would not wish to slight <end>
it was better to pay my visit  then   

he hesitated  got up  walked to a window <end>

 in short   said he   perhaps  miss woodhouse  i think you can
hardly be quite without suspicion   

he looked at her  as if wanting to read her thoughts <end>  she hardly
knew what to say <end>  it seemed like the forerunner of something
absolutely serious  which she did not wish <end>  forcing herself
to speak  therefore  in the hope of putting it by  she calmly said 

 you are quite in the right  it was most natural to pay your visit  then   

he was silent <end>  she believed he was looking at her  probably reflecting
on what she had said  and trying to understand the manner <end>
she heard him sigh <end>  it was natural for him to feel that he had
 cause  to sigh <end>  he could not believe her to be encouraging him <end>
a few awkward moments passed  and he sat down again  and in a more
determined manner said 

 it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be
given to hartfield <end>  my regard for hartfield is most warm   

he stopt again  rose again  and seemed quite embarrassed <end>  
he was more in love with her than emma had supposed  and who can say
how it might have ended  if his father had not made his appearance 
mr <end> woodhouse soon followed  and the necessity of exertion made
him composed <end>

a very few minutes more  however  completed the present trial <end>
mr <end> weston  always alert when business was to be done  and as
incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable 
as of foreseeing any that was doubtful  said   it was time to go  
and the young man  though he might and did sigh  could not but agree 
to take leave <end>

 i shall hear about you all   said he   that is my chief consolation <end>
i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you <end>  i have
engaged mrs <end> weston to correspond with me <end>  she has been so kind as
to promise it <end>  oh  the blessing of a female correspondent  when one
is really interested in the absent   she will tell me every thing <end>
in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again <end> 

a very friendly shake of the hand  a very earnest  good bye  
closed the speech  and the door had soon shut out frank churchill <end>
short had been the notice  short their meeting  he was gone  and emma
felt so sorry to part  and foresaw so great a loss to their little
society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry 
and feeling it too much <end>

it was a sad change <end>  they had been meeting almost every day
since his arrival <end>  certainly his being at randalls had given
great spirit to the last two weeks  indescribable spirit  the idea 
the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought 
the assurance of his attentions  his liveliness  his manners 
it had been a very happy fortnight  and forlorn must be the sinking
from it into the common course of hartfield days <end>  to complete every
other recommendation  he had  almost  told her that he loved her <end>
what strength  or what constancy of affection he might be subject to 
was another point  but at present she could not doubt his having
a decidedly warm admiration  a conscious preference of herself 
and this persuasion  joined to all the rest  made her think that
she  must  be a little in love with him  in spite of every previous
determination against it <end>

 i certainly must   said she <end>   this sensation of listlessness 
weariness  stupidity  this disinclination to sit down and employ myself 
this feeling of every thing s being dull and insipid about the house   
i must be in love  i should be the oddest creature in the world if i
were not  for a few weeks at least <end>  well  evil to some is always
good to others <end>  i shall have many fellow mourners for the ball 
if not for frank churchill  but mr <end> knightley will be happy <end>
he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes <end> 

mr <end> knightley  however  shewed no triumphant happiness <end>  he could
not say that he was sorry on his own account  his very cheerful look
would have contradicted him if he had  but he said  and very steadily 
that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others  and with
considerable kindness added 

 you  emma  who have so few opportunities of dancing  you are really
out of luck  you are very much out of luck  

it was some days before she saw jane fairfax  to judge of her
honest regret in this woeful change  but when they did meet 
her composure was odious <end>  she had been particularly unwell  however 
suffering from headache to a degree  which made her aunt declare 
that had the ball taken place  she did not think jane could have
attended it  and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming
indifference to the languor of ill health <end>



chapter xiii


emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love <end>  her ideas
only varied as to the how much <end>  at first  she thought it was a good deal 
and afterwards  but little <end>  she had great pleasure in hearing frank
churchill talked of  and  for his sake  greater pleasure than ever
in seeing mr <end> and mrs <end> weston  she was very often thinking of him 
and quite impatient for a letter  that she might know how he was 
how were his spirits  how was his aunt  and what was the chance
of his coming to randalls again this spring <end>  but  on the other hand 
she could not admit herself to be unhappy  nor  after the
first morning  to be less disposed for employment than usual 
she was still busy and cheerful  and  pleasing as he was  she could
yet imagine him to have faults  and farther  though thinking of him
so much  and  as she sat drawing or working  forming a thousand
amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment 
fancying interesting dialogues  and inventing elegant letters 
the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she
 refused   him  <end>  their affection was always to subside into friendship <end>
every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting 
but still they were to part <end>  when she became sensible of this 
it struck her that she could not be very much in love  for in spite
of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father 
never to marry  a strong attachment certainly must produce more
of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings <end>

 i do not find myself making any use of the word  sacrifice    said she <end>  
 in not one of all my clever replies  my delicate negatives 
is there any allusion to making a sacrifice <end>  i do suspect that he
is not really necessary to my happiness <end>  so much the better <end>
i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do <end>  i am
quite enough in love <end>  i should be sorry to be more <end> 

upon the whole  she was equally contented with her view of his feelings <end>

  he  is undoubtedly very much in love  every thing denotes it  very much
in love indeed   and when he comes again  if his affection continue 
i must be on my guard not to encourage it <end>  it would be most
inexcusable to do otherwise  as my own mind is quite made up <end>
not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto <end>
no  if he had believed me at all to share his feelings  he would
not have been so wretched <end>  could he have thought himself encouraged 
his looks and language at parting would have been different <end>  
still  however  i must be on my guard <end>  this is in the supposition
of his attachment continuing what it now is  but i do not know that i
expect it will  i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man  
i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy <end>  
his feelings are warm  but i can imagine them rather changeable <end>  
every consideration of the subject  in short  makes me thankful
that my happiness is not more deeply involved <end>  i shall do very well
again after a little while  and then  it will be a good thing over 
for they say every body is in love once in their lives  and i shall
have been let off easily <end> 

when his letter to mrs <end> weston arrived  emma had the perusal of it 
and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made
her at first shake her head over her own sensations  and think she
had undervalued their strength <end>  it was a long  well written letter 
giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings 
expressing all the affection  gratitude  and respect which was
natural and honourable  and describing every thing exterior and local
that could be supposed attractive  with spirit and precision <end>
no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern  it was the
language of real feeling towards mrs <end> weston  and the transition
from highbury to enscombe  the contrast between the places in some
of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on
to shew how keenly it was felt  and how much more might have been
said but for the restraints of propriety <end>  the charm of her own
name was not wanting <end>   miss   woodhouse  appeared more than once 
and never without a something of pleasing connexion  either a
compliment to her taste  or a remembrance of what she had said 
and in the very last time of its meeting her eye  unadorned as it
was by any such broad wreath of gallantry  she yet could discern
the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment
perhaps of all conveyed <end>  compressed into the very lowest vacant
corner were these words   i had not a spare moment on tuesday 
as you know  for miss woodhouse s beautiful little friend <end>  pray make
my excuses and adieus to her <end>   this  emma could not doubt  was all
for herself <end>  harriet was remembered only from being  her  friend <end>
his information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor
better than had been anticipated  mrs <end> churchill was recovering 
and he dared not yet  even in his own imagination  fix a time for
coming to randalls again <end>

gratifying  however  and stimulative as was the letter in the
material part  its sentiments  she yet found  when it was folded up
and returned to mrs <end> weston  that it had not added any lasting warmth 
that she could still do without the writer  and that he must learn
to do without her <end>  her intentions were unchanged <end>  her resolution
of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for
his subsequent consolation and happiness <end>  his recollection of harriet 
and the words which clothed it  the  beautiful little friend  
suggested to her the idea of harriet s succeeding her in his affections <end>
was it impossible   no <end>  harriet undoubtedly was greatly his
inferior in understanding  but he had been very much struck with
the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner 
and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in
her favour <end>  for harriet  it would be advantageous and delightful indeed <end>

 i must not dwell upon it   said she <end>   i must not think of it <end>
i know the danger of indulging such speculations <end>  but stranger
things have happened  and when we cease to care for each other
as we do now  it will be the means of confirming us in that sort
of true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward
to with pleasure <end> 

it was well to have a comfort in store on harriet s behalf 
though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom  for evil
in that quarter was at hand <end>  as frank churchill s arrival had
succeeded mr <end> elton s engagement in the conversation of highbury 
as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first  so now
upon frank churchill s disappearance  mr <end> elton s concerns were
assuming the most irresistible form <end>  his wedding day was named <end>
he would soon be among them again  mr <end> elton and his bride <end>
there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe
before  mr <end> elton and his bride  was in every body s mouth 
and frank churchill was forgotten <end>  emma grew sick at the sound <end>
she had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr <end> elton 
and harriet s mind  she had been willing to hope  had been lately
gaining strength <end>  with mr <end> weston s ball in view at least 
there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things 
but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state
of composure as could stand against the actual approach  new carriage 
bell ringing  and all <end>

poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the
reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma
could give <end>  emma felt that she could not do too much for her 
that harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience 
but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing
any effect  for ever agreed to  without being able to make their opinions
the same <end>  harriet listened submissively  and said  it was very true  
it was just as miss woodhouse described  it was not worth while to
think about them  and she would not think about them any longer 
but no change of subject could avail  and the next half hour
saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before <end>
at last emma attacked her on another ground <end>

 your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about
mr <end> elton s marrying  harriet  is the strongest reproach you can
make  me  <end>  you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i
fell into <end>  it was all my doing  i know <end>  i have not forgotten it 
i assure you <end>  deceived myself  i did very miserably deceive you  
and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever <end>  do not imagine
me in danger of forgetting it <end> 

harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words
of eager exclamation <end>  emma continued 

 i have not said  exert yourself harriet for my sake  think less 
talk less of mr <end> elton for my sake  because for your own sake rather 
i would wish it to be done  for the sake of what is more important
than my comfort  a habit of self command in you  a consideration
of what is your duty  an attention to propriety  an endeavour
to avoid the suspicions of others  to save your health and credit 
and restore your tranquillity <end>  these are the motives which i
have been pressing on you <end>  they are very important  and sorry
i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them <end>
my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration <end>  i want
you to save yourself from greater pain <end>  perhaps i may sometimes
have felt that harriet would not forget what was due  or rather
what would be kind by me <end> 

this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest <end>
the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse 
whom she really loved extremely  made her wretched for a while 
and when the violence of grief was comforted away  still remained
powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it
very tolerably <end>

 you  who have been the best friend i ever had in my life  
want gratitude to you   nobody is equal to you   i care for nobody
as i do for you   oh   miss woodhouse  how ungrateful i have been  

such expressions  assisted as they were by every thing that look
and manner could do  made emma feel that she had never loved harriet
so well  nor valued her affection so highly before <end>

 there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart   said she
afterwards to herself <end>   there is nothing to be compared to it <end>
warmth and tenderness of heart  with an affectionate  open manner 
will beat all the clearness of head in the world  for attraction 
i am sure it will <end>  it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear
father so generally beloved  which gives isabella all her popularity <end>  
i have it not  but i know how to prize and respect it <end>  harriet is
my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives <end>
dear harriet   i would not change you for the clearest headed 
longest sighted  best judging female breathing <end>  oh  the coldness
of a jane fairfax   harriet is worth a hundred such  and for a wife  
a sensible man s wife  it is invaluable <end>  i mention no names 
but happy the man who changes emma for harriet  



chapter xiv


mrs <end> elton was first seen at church   but though devotion might
be interrupted  curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew 
and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid 
to settle whether she were very pretty indeed  or only rather pretty 
or not pretty at all <end>

emma had feelings  less of curiosity than of pride or propriety 
to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects 
and she made a point of harriet s going with her  that the worst of
the business might be gone through as soon as possible <end>

she could not enter the house again  could not be in the same room
to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago 
to lace up her boot  without  recollecting  <end>  a thousand vexatious
thoughts would recur <end>  compliments  charades  and horrible blunders 
and it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be
recollecting too  but she behaved very well  and was only rather
pale and silent <end>  the visit was of course short  and there was so
much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it  that emma
would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady 
and on no account to give one  beyond the nothing meaning terms
of being  elegantly dressed  and very pleasing <end> 

she did not really like her <end>  she would not be in a hurry to find fault 
but she suspected that there was no elegance   ease  but not elegance <end>  
she was almost sure that for a young woman  a stranger  a bride 
there was too much ease <end>  her person was rather good  her face
not unpretty  but neither feature  nor air  nor voice  nor manner 
were elegant <end>  emma thought at least it would turn out so <end>

as for mr <end> elton  his manners did not appear  but no  she would
not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners <end>
it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits 
and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it <end>
the woman was better off  she might have the assistance of fine clothes 
and the privilege of bashfulness  but the man had only his own
good sense to depend on  and when she considered how peculiarly
unlucky poor mr <end> elton was in being in the same room at once with
the woman he had just married  the woman he had wanted to marry 
and the woman whom he had been expected to marry  she must allow him
to have the right to look as little wise  and to be as much affectedly 
and as little really easy as could be <end>

 well  miss woodhouse   said harriet  when they had quitted
the house  and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin 
 well  miss woodhouse   with a gentle sigh   what do you think of her   
is not she very charming  

there was a little hesitation in emma s answer <end>

 oh  yes  very  a very pleasing young woman <end> 

 i think her beautiful  quite beautiful <end> 

 very nicely dressed  indeed  a remarkably elegant gown <end> 

 i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love <end> 

 oh  no  there is nothing to surprize one at all <end>  a pretty fortune 
and she came in his way <end> 

 i dare say   returned harriet  sighing again   i dare say she
was very much attached to him <end> 

 perhaps she might  but it is not every man s fate to marry the
woman who loves him best <end>  miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home 
and thought this the best offer she was likely to have <end> 

 yes   said harriet earnestly   and well she might  nobody could ever
have a better <end>  well  i wish them happy with all my heart <end>  and now 
miss woodhouse  i do not think i shall mind seeing them again <end>
he is just as superior as ever   but being married  you know 
it is quite a different thing <end>  no  indeed  miss woodhouse  you need
not be afraid  i can sit and admire him now without any great misery <end>
to know that he has not thrown himself away  is such a comfort   
she does seem a charming young woman  just what he deserves <end>
happy creature   he called her  augusta <end>   how delightful  

when the visit was returned  emma made up her mind <end>  she could then
see more and judge better <end>  from harriet s happening not to be
at hartfield  and her father s being present to engage mr <end> elton 
she had a quarter of an hour of the lady s conversation to herself 
and could composedly attend to her  and the quarter of an hour quite
convinced her that mrs <end> elton was a vain woman  extremely well
satisfied with herself  and thinking much of her own importance 
that she meant to shine and be very superior  but with manners which
had been formed in a bad school  pert and familiar  that all her
notions were drawn from one set of people  and one style of living 
that if not foolish she was ignorant  and that her society would
certainly do mr <end> elton no good <end>

harriet would have been a better match <end>  if not wise or refined herself 
she would have connected him with those who were  but miss hawkins 
it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit  had been the best
of her own set <end>  the rich brother in law near bristol was the pride
of the alliance  and his place and his carriages were the pride
of him <end>

the very first subject after being seated was maple grove   my brother
mr <end> suckling s seat    a comparison of hartfield to maple grove <end>
the grounds of hartfield were small  but neat and pretty  and the
house was modern and well built <end> mrs <end> elton seemed most favourably
impressed by the size of the room  the entrance  and all that she
could see or imagine <end>   very like maple grove indeed   she was quite
struck by the likeness   that room was the very shape and size
of the morning room at maple grove  her sister s favourite room <end>   
mr <end> elton was appealed to <end>   was not it astonishingly like   
she could really almost fancy herself at maple grove <end> 

 and the staircase  you know  as i came in  i observed how very like
the staircase was  placed exactly in the same part of the house <end>
i really could not help exclaiming   i assure you  miss woodhouse 
it is very delightful to me  to be reminded of a place i am so
extremely partial to as maple grove <end>  i have spent so many happy
months there   with a little sigh of sentiment  <end> a charming place 
undoubtedly <end>  every body who sees it is struck by its beauty 
but to me  it has been quite a home <end>  whenever you are transplanted 
like me  miss woodhouse  you will understand how very delightful it
is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind <end>
i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony <end> 

emma made as slight a reply as she could  but it was fully sufficient
for mrs <end> elton  who only wanted to be talking herself <end>

 so extremely like maple grove   and it is not merely the house  
the grounds  i assure you  as far as i could observe  are strikingly
like <end>  the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here 
and stand very much in the same way  just across the lawn 
and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree  with a bench round it 
which put me so exactly in mind   my brother and sister will be
enchanted with this place <end>  people who have extensive grounds
themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style <end> 

emma doubted the truth of this sentiment <end>  she had a great idea
that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little
for the extensive grounds of any body else  but it was not worth
while to attack an error so double dyed  and therefore only said
in reply 

 when you have seen more of this country  i am afraid you will think
you have overrated hartfield <end>  surry is full of beauties <end> 

 oh  yes  i am quite aware of that <end>  it is the garden of england 
you know <end>  surry is the garden of england <end> 

 yes  but we must not rest our claims on that distinction <end>
many counties  i believe  are called the garden of england 
as well as surry <end> 

 no  i fancy not   replied mrs <end> elton  with a most satisfied smile <end> 
i never heard any county but surry called so <end> 

emma was silenced <end>

 my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring 
or summer at farthest   continued mrs <end> elton   and that will be
our time for exploring <end>  while they are with us  we shall explore
a great deal  i dare say <end>  they will have their barouche landau 
of course  which holds four perfectly  and therefore  without saying
any thing of  our  carriage  we should be able to explore the different
beauties extremely well <end>  they would hardly come in their chaise 
i think  at that season of the year <end>  indeed  when the time draws on 
i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche landau 
it will be so very much preferable <end>  when people come into a beautiful
country of this sort  you know  miss woodhouse  one naturally wishes
them to see as much as possible  and mr <end> suckling is extremely fond
of exploring <end>  we explored to king s weston twice last summer 
in that way  most delightfully  just after their first having the
barouche landau <end>  you have many parties of that kind here  i suppose 
miss woodhouse  every summer  

 no  not immediately here <end>  we are rather out of distance of the very
striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of 
and we are a very quiet set of people  i believe  more disposed
to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure <end> 

 ah  there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort <end>
nobody can be more devoted to home than i am <end>  i was quite
a proverb for it at maple grove <end>  many a time has selina said 
when she has been going to bristol   i really cannot get this girl
to move from the house <end>  i absolutely must go in by myself  though i
hate being stuck up in the barouche landau without a companion 
but augusta  i believe  with her own good will  would never stir
beyond the park paling <end>   many a time has she said so  and yet i
am no advocate for entire seclusion <end>  i think  on the contrary 
when people shut themselves up entirely from society  it is a very
bad thing  and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in
a proper degree  without living in it either too much or too little <end>
i perfectly understand your situation  however  miss woodhouse  
 looking towards mr <end> woodhouse   your father s state of health must
be a great drawback <end>  why does not he try bath   indeed he should <end>
let me recommend bath to you <end>  i assure you i have no doubt of its doing
mr <end> woodhouse good <end> 

 my father tried it more than once  formerly  but without receiving
any benefit  and mr <end> perry  whose name  i dare say  is not unknown
to you  does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be
useful now <end> 

 ah  that s a great pity  for i assure you  miss woodhouse 
where the waters do agree  it is quite wonderful the relief
they give <end>  in my bath life  i have seen such instances of it 
and it is so cheerful a place  that it could not fail of being of
use to mr <end> woodhouse s spirits  which  i understand  are sometimes
much depressed <end>  and as to its recommendations to  you   i fancy i
need not take much pains to dwell on them <end>  the advantages of bath
to the young are pretty generally understood <end>  it would be a charming
introduction for you  who have lived so secluded a life  and i could
immediately secure you some of the best society in the place <end>
a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance  and my
particular friend  mrs <end> partridge  the lady i have always resided
with when in bath  would be most happy to shew you any attentions 
and would be the very person for you to go into public with <end> 

it was as much as emma could bear  without being impolite <end>
the idea of her being indebted to mrs <end> elton for what was called
an  introduction   of her going into public under the auspices
of a friend of mrs <end> elton s  probably some vulgar  dashing widow 
who  with the help of a boarder  just made a shift to live   
the dignity of miss woodhouse  of hartfield  was sunk indeed 

she restrained herself  however  from any of the reproofs she could
have given  and only thanked mrs <end> elton coolly   but their going
to bath was quite out of the question  and she was not perfectly
convinced that the place might suit her better than her father <end> 
and then  to prevent farther outrage and indignation  changed the
subject directly <end>

 i do not ask whether you are musical  mrs <end> elton <end>  upon these occasions 
a lady s character generally precedes her  and highbury has long
known that you are a superior performer <end> 

 oh  no  indeed  i must protest against any such idea <end>
a superior performer   very far from it  i assure you <end>
consider from how partial a quarter your information came <end>
i am doatingly fond of music  passionately fond   and my friends
say i am not entirely devoid of taste  but as to any thing else 
upon my honour my performance is  mediocre  to the last degree <end>
you  miss woodhouse  i well know  play delightfully <end>  i assure you
it has been the greatest satisfaction  comfort  and delight to me 
to hear what a musical society i am got into <end>  i absolutely cannot
do without music <end>  it is a necessary of life to me  and having always
been used to a very musical society  both at maple grove and in bath 
it would have been a most serious sacrifice <end>  i honestly said as much
to mr <end> e <end> when he was speaking of my future home  and expressing
his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable 
and the inferiority of the house too  knowing what i had been
accustomed to  of course he was not wholly without apprehension <end>
when he was speaking of it in that way  i honestly said that  the 
 world  i could give up  parties  balls  plays  for i had no fear
of retirement <end>  blessed with so many resources within myself 
the world was not necessary to  me  <end>  i could do very well without it <end>
to those who had no resources it was a different thing  but my
resources made me quite independent <end>  and as to smaller sized rooms
than i had been used to  i really could not give it a thought <end>
i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description <end>
certainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove  but i
did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness 
nor were spacious apartments <end>   but   said i   to be quite honest 
i do not think i can live without something of a musical society <end>
i condition for nothing else  but without music  life would be a blank
to me <end>  

 we cannot suppose   said emma  smiling   that mr <end> elton would hesitate
to assure you of there being a  very  musical society in highbury 
and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than
may be pardoned  in consideration of the motive <end> 

 no  indeed  i have no doubts at all on that head <end>  i am delighted
to find myself in such a circle <end>  i hope we shall have many sweet
little concerts together <end>  i think  miss woodhouse  you and i
must establish a musical club  and have regular weekly meetings
at your house  or ours <end>  will not it be a good plan   if  we 
exert ourselves  i think we shall not be long in want of allies <end>
something of that nature would be particularly desirable for  me  
as an inducement to keep me in practice  for married women  you know  
there is a sad story against them  in general <end>  they are but too apt
to give up music <end> 

 but you  who are so extremely fond of it  there can
be no danger  surely  

 i should hope not  but really when i look around among my acquaintance 
i tremble <end>  selina has entirely given up music  never touches
the instrument  though she played sweetly <end>  and the same may be said
of mrs <end> jeffereys  clara partridge  that was  and of the two milmans 
now mrs <end> bird and mrs <end> james cooper  and of more than i can enumerate <end>
upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright <end>  i used to be
quite angry with selina  but really i begin now to comprehend
that a married woman has many things to call her attention <end>
i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper <end> 

 but every thing of that kind   said emma   will soon
be in so regular a train   

 well   said mrs <end> elton  laughing   we shall see <end> 

emma  finding her so determined upon neglecting her music 
had nothing more to say  and  after a moment s pause  mrs <end> elton
chose another subject <end>

 we have been calling at randalls   said she   and found them
both at home  and very pleasant people they seem to be <end>
i like them extremely <end>  mr <end> weston seems an excellent creature  
quite a first rate favourite with me already  i assure you <end>
and  she  appears so truly good  there is something so motherly
and kind hearted about her  that it wins upon one directly <end>
she was your governess  i think  

emma was almost too much astonished to answer  but mrs <end> elton
hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on <end>

 having understood as much  i was rather astonished to find her
so very lady like   but she is really quite the gentlewoman <end> 

 mrs <end> weston s manners   said emma   were always particularly good <end>
their propriety  simplicity  and elegance  would make them the safest
model for any young woman <end> 

 and who do you think came in while we were there  

emma was quite at a loss <end>  the tone implied some old acquaintance  
and how could she possibly guess 

 knightley   continued mrs <end> elton   knightley himself   was not
it lucky   for  not being within when he called the other day 
i had never seen him before  and of course  as so particular a
friend of mr <end> e <end> s  i had a great curiosity <end>   my friend knightley 
had been so often mentioned  that i was really impatient to see him 
and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not
be ashamed of his friend <end>  knightley is quite the gentleman <end>
i like him very much <end>  decidedly  i think  a very gentleman like man <end> 

happily  it was now time to be gone <end>  they were off  and emma
could breathe <end>

 insufferable woman   was her immediate exclamation <end>   worse than i
had supposed <end>  absolutely insufferable   knightley   i could not
have believed it <end>  knightley   never seen him in her life before 
and call him knightley   and discover that he is a gentleman 
a little upstart  vulgar being  with her mr <end> e <end>  and her  caro   sposo  
and her resources  and all her airs of pert pretension and
underbred finery <end>  actually to discover that mr <end> knightley is
a gentleman   i doubt whether he will return the compliment 
and discover her to be a lady <end>  i could not have believed it 
and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club 
one would fancy we were bosom friends   and mrs <end> weston   
astonished that the person who had brought me up should be
a gentlewoman   worse and worse <end>  i never met with her equal <end>
much beyond my hopes <end>  harriet is disgraced by any comparison <end>
oh  what would frank churchill say to her  if he were here 
how angry and how diverted he would be   ah  there i am  
thinking of him directly <end>  always the first person to be thought of 
how i catch myself out   frank churchill comes as regularly into
my mind    

all this ran so glibly through her thoughts  that by the time
her father had arranged himself  after the bustle of the eltons 
departure  and was ready to speak  she was very tolerably capable
of attending <end>

 well  my dear   he deliberately began   considering we never saw
her before  she seems a very pretty sort of young lady  and i dare say
she was very much pleased with you <end>  she speaks a little too quick <end>
a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear <end>
but i believe i am nice  i do not like strange voices  and nobody speaks
like you and poor miss taylor <end>  however  she seems a very obliging 
pretty behaved young lady  and no doubt will make him a very good wife <end>
though i think he had better not have married <end>  i made the best
excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs <end> elton
on this happy occasion  i said that i hoped i  should  in the course
of the summer <end>  but i ought to have gone before <end>  not to wait upon
a bride is very remiss <end>  ah  it shews what a sad invalid i am 
but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane <end> 

 i dare say your apologies were accepted  sir <end>  mr <end> elton knows you <end> 

 yes   but a young lady  a bride  i ought to have paid my respects
to her if possible <end>  it was being very deficient <end> 

 but  my dear papa  you are no friend to matrimony  and therefore
why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a  bride  
it ought to be no recommendation to  you  <end>  it is encouraging people
to marry if you make so much of them <end> 

 no  my dear  i never encouraged any body to marry  but i would
always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady  and a bride 
especially  is never to be neglected <end>  more is avowedly due to  her  <end>
a bride  you know  my dear  is always the first in company 
let the others be who they may <end> 

 well  papa  if this is not encouragement to marry  i do not know
what is <end>  and i should never have expected you to be lending your
sanction to such vanity baits for poor young ladies <end> 

 my dear  you do not understand me <end>  this is a
matter of mere common politeness and good breeding 
and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry <end> 

emma had done <end>  her father was growing nervous  and could not
understand  her  <end>  her mind returned to mrs <end> elton s offences 
and long  very long  did they occupy her <end>



chapter xv


emma was not required  by any subsequent discovery  to retract her ill
opinion of mrs <end> elton <end>  her observation had been pretty correct <end>
such as mrs <end> elton appeared to her on this second interview 
such she appeared whenever they met again   self important  presuming 
familiar  ignorant  and ill bred <end> she had a little beauty and a
little accomplishment  but so little judgment that she thought herself
coming with superior knowledge of the world  to enliven and improve
a country neighbourhood  and conceived miss hawkins to have held
such a place in society as mrs <end> elton s consequence only could surpass <end>

there was no reason to suppose mr <end> elton thought at all differently
from his wife <end>  he seemed not merely happy with her  but proud <end>
he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such
a woman to highbury  as not even miss woodhouse could equal 
and the greater part of her new acquaintance  disposed to commend 
or not in the habit of judging  following the lead of miss bates s
good will  or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever
and as agreeable as she professed herself  were very well satisfied 
so that mrs <end> elton s praise passed from one mouth to another as it
ought to do  unimpeded by miss woodhouse  who readily continued her
first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being  very
pleasant and very elegantly dressed <end> 

in one respect mrs <end> elton grew even worse than she had appeared
at first <end>  her feelings altered towards emma <end>  offended  probably 
by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with 
she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold
and distant  and though the effect was agreeable  the ill will
which produced it was necessarily increasing emma s dislike <end>
her manners  too  and mr <end> elton s  were unpleasant towards harriet <end>
they were sneering and negligent <end>  emma hoped it must rapidly work
harriet s cure  but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour
sunk them both very much <end>  it was not to be doubted that poor
harriet s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve 
and her own share in the story  under a colouring the least favourable
to her and the most soothing to him  had in all likelihood been
given also <end>  she was  of course  the object of their joint dislike <end>  
when they had nothing else to say  it must be always easy to begin
abusing miss woodhouse  and the enmity which they dared not shew
in open disrespect to her  found a broader vent in contemptuous
treatment of harriet <end>

mrs <end> elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax  and from the first <end>
not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be
supposed to recommend the other  but from the very first  and she
was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration  
but without solicitation  or plea  or privilege  she must be wanting
to assist and befriend her <end>  before emma had forfeited her confidence 
and about the third time of their meeting  she heard all mrs <end> elton s
knight errantry on the subject <end>  

 jane fairfax is absolutely charming  miss woodhouse <end>  i quite
rave about jane fairfax <end>  a sweet  interesting creature <end>  so mild
and ladylike  and with such talents   i assure you i think she
has very extraordinary talents <end>  i do not scruple to say that she
plays extremely well <end>  i know enough of music to speak decidedly
on that point <end>  oh  she is absolutely charming   you will laugh at
my warmth  but  upon my word  i talk of nothing but jane fairfax <end>  
and her situation is so calculated to affect one   miss woodhouse 
we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her <end>
we must bring her forward <end>  such talent as hers must not be suffered
to remain unknown <end>  i dare say you have heard those charming lines of
the poet 

         full many a flower is born to blush unseen 
           and waste its fragrance on the desert air <end> 

we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax <end> 

 i cannot think there is any danger of it   was emma s calm answer  
 and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax s situation
and understand what her home has been  with colonel and mrs <end> campbell 
i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown <end> 

 oh  but dear miss woodhouse  she is now in such retirement 
such obscurity  so thrown away <end>  whatever advantages she may have
enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end   and i think
she feels it <end>  i am sure she does <end>  she is very timid and silent <end>
one can see that she feels the want of encouragement <end>  i like her
the better for it <end>  i must confess it is a recommendation to me <end>
i am a great advocate for timidity  and i am sure one does
not often meet with it <end>  but in those who are at all inferior 
it is extremely prepossessing <end>  oh   i assure you  jane fairfax
is a very delightful character  and interests me more than i
can express <end> 

 you appear to feel a great deal  but i am not aware how you or any
of miss fairfax s acquaintance here  any of those who have known
her longer than yourself  can shew her any other attention than   

 my dear miss woodhouse  a vast deal may be done by those who dare
to act <end>  you and i need not be afraid <end>  if  we  set the example 
many will follow it as far as they can  though all have not
our situations <end>   we  have carriages to fetch and convey her home 
and  we  live in a style which could not make the addition of
jane fairfax  at any time  the least inconvenient <end>  i should be
extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner 
as could make me regret having asked  more  than jane fairfax
to partake of it <end>  i have no idea of that sort of thing <end>  it is
not likely that i  should   considering what i have been used to <end>
my greatest danger  perhaps  in housekeeping  may be quite the
other way  in doing too much  and being too careless of expense <end>
maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be  
for we do not at all affect to equal my brother  mr <end> suckling 
in income <end>  however  my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax <end>  
i shall certainly have her very often at my house  shall introduce
her wherever i can  shall have musical parties to draw out her talents 
and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation <end>
my acquaintance is so very extensive  that i have little doubt
of hearing of something to suit her shortly <end>  i shall introduce her 
of course  very particularly to my brother and sister when they come
to us <end>  i am sure they will like her extremely  and when she gets
a little acquainted with them  her fears will completely wear off 
for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is
highly conciliating <end>  i shall have her very often indeed while they
are with me  and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in
the barouche landau in some of our exploring parties <end> 

 poor jane fairfax    thought emma <end>   you have not deserved this <end>
you may have done wrong with regard to mr <end> dixon  but this is a
punishment beyond what you can have merited   the kindness and protection
of mrs <end> elton    jane fairfax and jane fairfax <end>   heavens   let me
not suppose that she dares go about  emma woodhouse ing me   
but upon my honour  there seems no limits to the licentiousness
of that woman s tongue  

emma had not to listen to such paradings again  to any so exclusively
addressed to herself  so disgustingly decorated with a  dear miss
woodhouse <end>   the change on mrs <end> elton s side soon afterwards appeared 
and she was left in peace  neither forced to be the very particular
friend of mrs <end> elton  nor  under mrs <end> elton s guidance  the very
active patroness of jane fairfax  and only sharing with others in a
general way  in knowing what was felt  what was meditated  what was done <end>

she looked on with some amusement <end>  miss bates s gratitude for
mrs <end> elton s attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless
simplicity and warmth <end>  she was quite one of her worthies  
the most amiable  affable  delightful woman  just as accomplished
and condescending as mrs <end> elton meant to be considered <end>
emma s only surprize was that jane fairfax should accept
those attentions and tolerate mrs <end> elton as she seemed to do <end>
she heard of her walking with the eltons  sitting with the eltons 
spending a day with the eltons   this was astonishing   she could not
have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of miss fairfax
could endure such society and friendship as the vicarage had to offer <end>

 she is a riddle  quite a riddle   said she <end>   to chuse to remain
here month after month  under privations of every sort   and now
to chuse the mortification of mrs <end> elton s notice and the penury
of her conversation  rather than return to the superior companions
who have always loved her with such real  generous affection <end> 

jane had come to highbury professedly for three months  the campbells
were gone to ireland for three months  but now the campbells
had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer 
and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there <end>
according to miss bates  it all came from her  mrs <end> dixon had
written most pressingly <end>  would jane but go  means were to be found 
servants sent  friends contrived  no travelling difficulty allowed
to exist  but still she had declined it 

 she must have some motive  more powerful than appears  for refusing
this invitation   was emma s conclusion <end>   she must be under some
sort of penance  inflicted either by the campbells or herself <end>
there is great fear  great caution  great resolution somewhere <end>  
she is  not  to be with the  dixons  <end>  the decree is issued by somebody <end>
but why must she consent to be with the eltons   here is quite a
separate puzzle <end> 

upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject 
before the few who knew her opinion of mrs <end> elton  mrs <end> weston
ventured this apology for jane <end>

 we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage 
my dear emma  but it is better than being always at home <end>
her aunt is a good creature  but  as a constant companion 
must be very tiresome <end>  we must consider what miss fairfax quits 
before we condemn her taste for what she goes to <end> 

 you are right  mrs <end> weston   said mr <end> knightley warmly   miss fairfax
is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs <end> elton <end>
could she have chosen with whom to associate  she would not have
chosen her <end>  but  with a reproachful smile at emma  she receives
attentions from mrs <end> elton  which nobody else pays her <end> 

emma felt that mrs <end> weston was giving her a momentary glance 
and she was herself struck by his warmth <end>  with a faint blush 
she presently replied 

 such attentions as mrs <end> elton s  i should have imagined 
would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax <end>  mrs <end> elton s
invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting <end> 

 i should not wonder   said mrs <end> weston   if miss fairfax were to have
been drawn on beyond her own inclination  by her aunt s eagerness
in accepting mrs <end> elton s civilities for her <end>  poor miss bates may
very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater
appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated 
in spite of the very natural wish of a little change <end> 

both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again  and after a few
minutes silence  he said 

 another thing must be taken into consideration too  mrs <end> elton
does not talk  to  miss fairfax as she speaks  of  her <end>  we all know
the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou  the plainest
spoken amongst us  we all feel the influence of a something beyond
common civility in our personal intercourse with each other  
a something more early implanted <end>  we cannot give any body the
disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before <end>
we feel things differently <end>  and besides the operation of this 
as a general principle  you may be sure that miss fairfax awes
mrs <end> elton by her superiority both of mind and manner  and that 
face to face  mrs <end> elton treats her with all the respect which she
has a claim to <end>  such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell
in mrs <end> elton s way before  and no degree of vanity can prevent
her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action  if not
in consciousness <end> 

 i know how highly you think of jane fairfax   said emma <end>
little henry was in her thoughts  and a mixture of alarm and delicacy
made her irresolute what else to say <end>

 yes   he replied   any body may know how highly i think of her <end> 

 and yet   said emma  beginning hastily and with an arch look 
but soon stopping  it was better  however  to know the worst at once  
she hurried on   and yet  perhaps  you may hardly be aware yourself
how highly it is <end>  the extent of your admiration may take you by
surprize some day or other <end> 

mr <end> knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick
leather gaiters  and either the exertion of getting them together 
or some other cause  brought the colour into his face  as he answered 

 oh  are you there   but you are miserably behindhand <end>  mr <end> cole
gave me a hint of it six weeks ago <end> 

he stopped <end>  emma felt her foot pressed by mrs <end> weston  and did
not herself know what to think <end>  in a moment he went on  

 that will never be  however  i can assure you <end>  miss fairfax 
i dare say  would not have me if i were to ask her  and i am very
sure i shall never ask her <end> 

emma returned her friend s pressure with interest  and was pleased
enough to exclaim 

 you are not vain  mr <end> knightley <end>  i will say that for you <end> 

he seemed hardly to hear her  he was thoughtful  and in a manner
which shewed him not pleased  soon afterwards said 

 so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax  

 no indeed i have not <end>  you have scolded me too much for match making 
for me to presume to take such a liberty with you <end>  what i said
just now  meant nothing <end>  one says those sort of things  of course 
without any idea of a serious meaning <end>  oh  no  upon my word i have not
the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body <end>
you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way 
if you were married <end> 

mr <end> knightley was thoughtful again <end>  the result of his reverie was 
 no  emma  i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will
ever take me by surprize <end>  i never had a thought of her in that way 
i assure you <end>   and soon afterwards   jane fairfax is a very charming
young woman  but not even jane fairfax is perfect <end>  she has a fault <end>
she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife <end> 

emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault <end>
 well   said she   and you soon silenced mr <end> cole  i suppose  

 yes  very soon <end>  he gave me a quiet hint  i told him he was mistaken 
he asked my pardon and said no more <end>  cole does not want to be wiser
or wittier than his neighbours <end> 

 in that respect how unlike dear mrs <end> elton  who wants to be wiser
and wittier than all the world   i wonder how she speaks of the coles  
what she calls them   how can she find any appellation for them 
deep enough in familiar vulgarity   she calls you  knightley  what can
she do for mr <end> cole   and so i am not to be surprized that jane
fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her <end>
mrs <end> weston  your argument weighs most with me <end>  i can much more
readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates 
than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfax s mind over
mrs <end> elton <end>  i have no faith in mrs <end> elton s acknowledging herself
the inferior in thought  word  or deed  or in her being under any
restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good breeding <end> i cannot
imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor
with praise  encouragement  and offers of service  that she will not be
continually detailing her magnificent intentions  from the procuring
her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful
exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche landau <end> 

 jane fairfax has feeling   said mr <end> knightley   i do not
accuse her of want of feeling <end>  her sensibilities  i suspect 
are strong  and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance 
patience  self controul  but it wants openness <end>  she is reserved 
more reserved  i think  than she used to be  and i love an
open temper <end>  no  till cole alluded to my supposed attachment 
it had never entered my head <end>  i saw jane fairfax and conversed with
her  with admiration and pleasure always  but with no thought beyond <end> 

 well  mrs <end> weston   said emma triumphantly when he left them 
 what do you say now to mr <end> knightley s marrying jane fairfax  

 why  really  dear emma  i say that he is so very much occupied
by the idea of  not  being in love with her  that i should not wonder
if it were to end in his being so at last <end>  do not beat me <end> 



chapter xvi


every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr <end> elton 
was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage <end>  dinner parties and
evening parties were made for him and his lady  and invitations
flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending
they were never to have a disengaged day <end>

 i see how it is   said she <end>   i see what a life i am to lead
among you <end>  upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated <end>
we really seem quite the fashion <end>  if this is living in the country 
it is nothing very formidable <end>  from monday next to saturday 
i assure you we have not a disengaged day   a woman with fewer
resources than i have  need not have been at a loss <end> 

no invitation came amiss to her <end>  her bath habits made evening parties
perfectly natural to her  and maple grove had given her a taste
for dinners <end>  she was a little shocked at the want of two
drawing rooms  at the poor attempt at rout cakes  and there being
no ice in the highbury card parties <end> mrs <end> bates  mrs <end> perry 
mrs <end> goddard and others  were a good deal behind hand in knowledge
of the world  but she would soon shew them how every thing ought
to be arranged <end>  in the course of the spring she must return their
civilities by one very superior party  in which her card tables
should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs
in the true style  and more waiters engaged for the evening
than their own establishment could furnish  to carry round
the refreshments at exactly the proper hour  and in the proper order <end>

emma  in the meanwhile  could not be satisfied without a dinner
at hartfield for the eltons <end>  they must not do less than others 
or she should be exposed to odious suspicions  and imagined capable
of pitiful resentment <end>  a dinner there must be <end>  after emma had
talked about it for ten minutes  mr <end> woodhouse felt no unwillingness 
and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom
of the table himself  with the usual regular difficulty of deciding
who should do it for him <end>

the persons to be invited  required little thought <end>  besides the eltons 
it must be the westons and mr <end> knightley  so far it was all of course  
and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must
be asked to make the eighth   but this invitation was not given
with equal satisfaction  and on many accounts emma was particularly
pleased by harriet s begging to be allowed to decline it <end>
 she would rather not be in his company more than she could help <end>
she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy
wife together  without feeling uncomfortable <end>  if miss woodhouse
would not be displeased  she would rather stay at home <end> 
it was precisely what emma would have wished  had she deemed it
possible enough for wishing <end>  she was delighted with the fortitude
of her little friend  for fortitude she knew it was in her to give
up being in company and stay at home  and she could now invite the
very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth  jane fairfax <end>  
since her last conversation with mrs <end> weston and mr <end> knightley 
she was more conscience stricken about jane fairfax than she had
often been <end>  mr <end> knightley s words dwelt with her <end>  he had said
that jane fairfax received attentions from mrs <end> elton which nobody
else paid her <end>

 this is very true   said she   at least as far as relates to me 
which was all that was meant  and it is very shameful <end>  of the same age  
and always knowing her  i ought to have been more her friend <end>  
she will never like me now <end>  i have neglected her too long <end>  but i
will shew her greater attention than i have done <end> 

every invitation was successful <end>  they were all disengaged and all happy <end>  
the preparatory interest of this dinner  however  was not yet over <end>
a circumstance rather unlucky occurred <end>  the two eldest little
knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of
some weeks in the spring  and their papa now proposed bringing them 
and staying one whole day at hartfield  which one day would be
the very day of this party <end>  his professional engagements did
not allow of his being put off  but both father and daughter were
disturbed by its happening so <end>  mr <end> woodhouse considered eight
persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear  
and here would be a ninth  and emma apprehended that it would
be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even
to hartfield for forty eight hours without falling in with a dinner party <end>

she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself 
by representing that though he certainly would make them nine 
yet he always said so little  that the increase of noise would be
very immaterial <end>  she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself 
to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed
to her instead of his brother <end>

the event was more favourable to mr <end> woodhouse than to emma <end>
john knightley came  but mr <end> weston was unexpectedly summoned to town
and must be absent on the very day <end>  he might be able to join them
in the evening  but certainly not to dinner <end>  mr <end> woodhouse was quite
at ease  and the seeing him so  with the arrival of the little boys
and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate 
removed the chief of even emma s vexation <end>

the day came  the party were punctually assembled  and mr <end> john knightley
seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable <end>
instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited
for dinner  he was talking to miss fairfax <end>  mrs <end> elton  as elegant
as lace and pearls could make her  he looked at in silence  
wanting only to observe enough for isabella s information  but miss
fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl  and he could
talk to her <end>  he had met her before breakfast as he was returning
from a walk with his little boys  when it had been just beginning
to rain <end>  it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject 
and he said 

 i hope you did not venture far  miss fairfax  this morning  or i
am sure you must have been wet <end>  we scarcely got home in time <end>
i hope you turned directly <end> 

 i went only to the post office   said she   and reached home
before the rain was much <end>  it is my daily errand <end>  i always fetch
the letters when i am here <end>  it saves trouble  and is a something
to get me out <end>  a walk before breakfast does me good <end> 

 not a walk in the rain  i should imagine <end> 

 no  but it did not absolutely rain when i set out <end> 

mr <end> john knightley smiled  and replied 

 that is to say  you chose to have your walk  for you were not six
yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you 
and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before <end>
the post office has a great charm at one period of our lives <end>
when you have lived to my age  you will begin to think letters are
never worth going through the rain for <end> 

there was a little blush  and then this answer 

 i must not hope to be ever situated as you are  in the midst of
every dearest connexion  and therefore i cannot expect that simply
growing older should make me indifferent about letters <end> 

 indifferent   oh  no  i never conceived you could become indifferent <end>
letters are no matter of indifference  they are generally a very
positive curse <end> 

 you are speaking of letters of business  mine are letters
of friendship <end> 

 i have often thought them the worst of the two   replied he coolly <end>
 business  you know  may bring money  but friendship hardly
ever does <end> 

 ah  you are not serious now <end>  i know mr <end> john knightley too well  
i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as
any body <end>  i can easily believe that letters are very little to you 
much less than to me  but it is not your being ten years older than
myself which makes the difference  it is not age  but situation <end>
you have every body dearest to you always at hand  i  probably 
never shall again  and therefore till i have outlived all my affections 
a post office  i think  must always have power to draw me out 
in worse weather than to day <end> 

 when i talked of your being altered by time  by the progress of years  
said john knightley   i meant to imply the change of situation
which time usually brings <end>  i consider one as including the other <end>
time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within
the daily circle  but that is not the change i had in view for you <end>
as an old friend  you will allow me to hope  miss fairfax  that ten
years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have <end> 

it was kindly said  and very far from giving offence <end>  a pleasant
 thank you  seemed meant to laugh it off  but a blush  a quivering lip 
a tear in the eye  shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh <end>
her attention was now claimed by mr <end> woodhouse  who being 
according to his custom on such occasions  making the circle of
his guests  and paying his particular compliments to the ladies 
was ending with her  and with all his mildest urbanity  said 

 i am very sorry to hear  miss fairfax  of your being out this
morning in the rain <end>  young ladies should take care of themselves <end>  
young ladies are delicate plants <end>  they should take care of their
health and their complexion <end>  my dear  did you change your stockings  

 yes  sir  i did indeed  and i am very much obliged by your kind
solicitude about me <end> 

 my dear miss fairfax  young ladies are very sure to be cared for <end>  
i hope your good grand mama and aunt are well <end>  they are some
of my very old friends <end>  i wish my health allowed me to be a
better neighbour <end>  you do us a great deal of honour to day  i am sure <end>
my daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness 
and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield <end> 

the kind hearted  polite old man might then sit down and feel
that he had done his duty  and made every fair lady welcome and easy <end>

by this time  the walk in the rain had reached mrs <end> elton 
and her remonstrances now opened upon jane <end>

 my dear jane  what is this i hear   going to the post office
in the rain   this must not be  i assure you <end>  you sad girl 
how could you do such a thing   it is a sign i was not there
to take care of you <end> 

jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold <end>

 oh  do not tell  me  <end>  you really are a very sad girl  and do not
know how to take care of yourself <end>  to the post office indeed 
mrs <end> weston  did you ever hear the like   you and i must positively
exert our authority <end> 

 my advice   said mrs <end> weston kindly and persuasively   i certainly
do feel tempted to give <end>  miss fairfax  you must not run such risks <end>  
liable as you have been to severe colds  indeed you ought
to be particularly careful  especially at this time of year <end>
the spring i always think requires more than common care <end>
better wait an hour or two  or even half a day for your letters 
than run the risk of bringing on your cough again <end>  now do not you
feel that you had   yes  i am sure you are much too reasonable <end>
you look as if you would not do such a thing again <end> 

 oh  she  shall   not  do such a thing again   eagerly rejoined
mrs <end> elton <end>   we will not allow her to do such a thing again    
and nodding significantly   there must be some arrangement made 
there must indeed <end>  i shall speak to mr <end> e <end> the man who fetches
our letters every morning  one of our men  i forget his name 
shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you <end>  that will obviate
all difficulties you know  and from  us  i really think  my dear jane 
you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation <end> 

 you are extremely kind   said jane   but i cannot give up my
early walk <end>  i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can 
i must walk somewhere  and the post office is an object  and upon
my word  i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before <end> 

 my dear jane  say no more about it <end>  the thing is determined 
that is  laughing affectedly  as far as i can presume to determine
any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master <end>  you know 
mrs <end> weston  you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves <end>
but i do flatter myself  my dear jane  that my influence is not entirely
worn out <end>  if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore 
consider that point as settled <end> 

 excuse me   said jane earnestly   i cannot by any means consent
to such an arrangement  so needlessly troublesome to your servant <end>
if the errand were not a pleasure to me  it could be done  as it
always is when i am not here  by my grandmama s <end> 

 oh  my dear  but so much as patty has to do   and it is a kindness
to employ our men <end> 

jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered  but instead
of answering  she began speaking again to mr <end> john knightley <end>

 the post office is a wonderful establishment   said she <end>  
 the regularity and despatch of it   if one thinks of all that it
has to do  and all that it does so well  it is really astonishing  

 it is certainly very well regulated <end> 

 so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears   so seldom
that a letter  among the thousands that are constantly passing
about the kingdom  is even carried wrong  and not one in a million 
i suppose  actually lost   and when one considers the variety
of hands  and of bad hands too  that are to be deciphered 
it increases the wonder <end> 

 the clerks grow expert from habit <end>  they must begin with some
quickness of sight and hand  and exercise improves them <end>  if you
want any farther explanation   continued he  smiling   they are
paid for it <end>  that is the key to a great deal of capacity <end>
the public pays and must be served well <end> 

the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of  and the usual
observations made <end>

 i have heard it asserted   said john knightley   that the same
sort of handwriting often prevails in a family  and where the
same master teaches  it is natural enough <end>  but for that reason 
i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females 
for boys have very little teaching after an early age  and scramble
into any hand they can get <end>  isabella and emma  i think  do write
very much alike <end>  i have not always known their writing apart <end> 

 yes   said his brother hesitatingly   there is a likeness <end>
i know what you mean  but emma s hand is the strongest <end> 

 isabella and emma both write beautifully   said mr <end> woodhouse 
 and always did <end>  and so does poor mrs <end> weston   with half a sigh
and half a smile at her <end>

 i never saw any gentleman s handwriting   emma began  looking also
at mrs <end> weston  but stopped  on perceiving that mrs <end> weston was
attending to some one else  and the pause gave her time to reflect 
 now  how am i going to introduce him   am i unequal to speaking
his name at once before all these people   is it necessary
for me to use any roundabout phrase   your yorkshire friend  
your correspondent in yorkshire   that would be the way  i suppose 
if i were very bad <end>  no  i can pronounce his name without the
smallest distress <end>  i certainly get better and better <end>  now for it <end> 

mrs <end> weston was disengaged and emma began again   mr <end> frank churchill
writes one of the best gentleman s hands i ever saw <end> 

 i do not admire it   said mr <end> knightley <end>   it is too small  
wants strength <end>  it is like a woman s writing <end> 

this was not submitted to by either lady <end>  they vindicated him
against the base aspersion <end>   no  it by no means wanted strength  
it was not a large hand  but very clear and certainly strong <end>
had not mrs <end> weston any letter about her to produce    no  she had
heard from him very lately  but having answered the letter  had put
it away <end>

 if we were in the other room   said emma   if i had my writing desk 
i am sure i could produce a specimen <end>  i have a note of his <end>  
do not you remember  mrs <end> weston  employing him to write for you
one day  

 he chose to say he was employed   

 well  well  i have that note  and can shew it after dinner
to convince mr <end> knightley <end> 

 oh  when a gallant young man  like mr <end> frank churchill  
said mr <end> knightley dryly   writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse 
he will  of course  put forth his best <end> 

dinner was on table <end>  mrs <end> elton  before she could be spoken to 
was ready  and before mr <end> woodhouse had reached her with his request
to be allowed to hand her into the dining parlour  was saying  

 must i go first   i really am ashamed of always leading the way <end> 

jane s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma <end>
she had heard and seen it all  and felt some curiosity to know
whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any <end>  she suspected
that it  had   that it would not have been so resolutely encountered
but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear 
and that it had not been in vain <end>  she thought there was an air
of greater happiness than usual  a glow both of complexion and spirits <end>

she could have made an inquiry or two  as to the expedition
and the expense of the irish mails   it was at her tongue s end  
but she abstained <end>  she was quite determined not to utter a word
that should hurt jane fairfax s feelings  and they followed
the other ladies out of the room  arm in arm  with an appearance
of good will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each <end>



chapter xvii


when the ladies returned to the drawing room after dinner  emma found
it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties   
with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs <end> elton
engross jane fairfax and slight herself <end>  she and mrs <end> weston were
obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together <end>
mrs <end> elton left them no choice <end>  if jane repressed her for a
little time  she soon began again  and though much that passed
between them was in a half whisper  especially on mrs <end> elton s side 
there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects 
the post office  catching cold  fetching letters  and friendship 
were long under discussion  and to them succeeded one  which must
be at least equally unpleasant to jane  inquiries whether she had
yet heard of any situation likely to suit her  and professions of
mrs <end> elton s meditated activity <end>

 here is april come   said she   i get quite anxious about you <end>
june will soon be here <end> 

 but i have never fixed on june or any other month  merely looked
forward to the summer in general <end> 

 but have you really heard of nothing  

 i have not even made any inquiry  i do not wish to make any yet <end> 

 oh  my dear  we cannot begin too early  you are not aware
of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing <end> 

 i not aware   said jane  shaking her head   dear mrs <end> elton 
who can have thought of it as i have done  

 but you have not seen so much of the world as i have <end>  you do not
know how many candidates there always are for the  first  situations <end>
i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove <end>
a cousin of mr <end> suckling  mrs <end> bragge  had such an infinity
of applications  every body was anxious to be in her family 
for she moves in the first circle <end>  wax candles in the schoolroom 
you may imagine how desirable   of all houses in the kingdom
mrs <end> bragge s is the one i would most wish to see you in <end> 

 colonel and mrs <end> campbell are to be in town again by midsummer  
said jane <end>   i must spend some time with them  i am sure they will
want it   afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself <end>
but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries
at present <end> 

 trouble  aye  i know your scruples <end>  you are afraid of giving
me trouble  but i assure you  my dear jane  the campbells can
hardly be more interested about you than i am <end>  i shall write
to mrs <end> partridge in a day or two  and shall give her a strict
charge to be on the look out for any thing eligible <end> 

 thank you  but i would rather you did not mention the subject
to her  till the time draws nearer  i do not wish to be giving
any body trouble <end> 

 but  my dear child  the time is drawing near  here is april 
and june  or say even july  is very near  with such business
to accomplish before us <end>  your inexperience really amuses me 
a situation such as you deserve  and your friends would require for you 
is no everyday occurrence  is not obtained at a moment s notice 
indeed  indeed  we must begin inquiring directly <end> 

 excuse me  ma am  but this is by no means my intention  i make no
inquiry myself  and should be sorry to have any made by my friends <end>
when i am quite determined as to the time  i am not at all afraid
of being long unemployed <end>  there are places in town  offices 
where inquiry would soon produce something  offices for the sale  
not quite of human flesh  but of human intellect <end> 

 oh  my dear  human flesh   you quite shock me  if you mean a fling
at the slave trade  i assure you mr <end> suckling was always rather
a friend to the abolition <end> 

 i did not mean  i was not thinking of the slave trade   replied jane 
 governess trade  i assure you  was all that i had in view 
widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on 
but as to the greater misery of the victims  i do not know where
it lies <end>  but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices 
and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon
meeting with something that would do <end> 

 something that would do   repeated mrs <end> elton <end>   aye   that  may
suit your humble ideas of yourself   i know what a modest creature
you are  but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up
with any thing that may offer  any inferior  commonplace situation 
in a family not moving in a certain circle  or able to command
the elegancies of life <end> 

 you are very obliging  but as to all that  i am very indifferent 
it would be no object to me to be with the rich  my mortifications 
i think  would only be the greater  i should suffer more from comparison <end>
a gentleman s family is all that i should condition for <end> 

 i know you  i know you  you would take up with any thing  but i
shall be a little more nice  and i am sure the good campbells will
be quite on my side  with your superior talents  you have a right
to move in the first circle <end>  your musical knowledge alone would
entitle you to name your own terms  have as many rooms as you like 
and mix in the family as much as you chose   that is  i do not know  
if you knew the harp  you might do all that  i am very sure 
but you sing as well as play   yes  i really believe you might 
even without the harp  stipulate for what you chose   and you must
and shall be delightfully  honourably and comfortably settled before
the campbells or i have any rest <end> 

 you may well class the delight  the honour  and the comfort
of such a situation together   said jane   they are pretty sure
to be equal  however  i am very serious in not wishing any thing
to be attempted at present for me <end>  i am exceedingly obliged to you 
mrs <end> elton  i am obliged to any body who feels for me  but i am
quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer <end>
for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am  and as
i am <end> 

 and i am quite serious too  i assure you   replied mrs <end> elton gaily 
 in resolving to be always on the watch  and employing my friends
to watch also  that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us <end> 

in this style she ran on  never thoroughly stopped by any thing
till mr <end> woodhouse came into the room  her vanity had then a change
of object  and emma heard her saying in the same half whisper to jane 

 here comes this dear old beau of mine  i protest   only think of his
gallantry in coming away before the other men   what a dear creature
he is   i assure you i like him excessively <end>  i admire all that quaint 
old fashioned politeness  it is much more to my taste than modern ease 
modern ease often disgusts me <end>  but this good old mr <end> woodhouse 
i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner <end>  oh   i assure
you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous <end>
i fancy i am rather a favourite  he took notice of my gown <end>
how do you like it   selina s choice  handsome  i think  but i
do not know whether it is not over trimmed  i have the greatest
dislike to the idea of being over trimmed  quite a horror of finery <end>
i must put on a few ornaments now  because it is expected of me <end>
a bride  you know  must appear like a bride  but my natural taste
is all for simplicity  a simple style of dress is so infinitely
preferable to finery <end>  but i am quite in the minority  i believe 
few people seem to value simplicity of dress   show and finery
are every thing <end>  i have some notion of putting such a trimming
as this to my white and silver poplin <end>  do you think it will
look well  

the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing room
when mr <end> weston made his appearance among them <end>  he had returned
to a late dinner  and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over <end>
he had been too much expected by the best judges  for surprize  
but there was great joy <end>  mr <end> woodhouse was almost as glad to see
him now  as he would have been sorry to see him before <end>  john knightley
only was in mute astonishment <end>  that a man who might have spent
his evening quietly at home after a day of business in london 
should set off again  and walk half a mile to another man s house 
for the sake of being in mixed company till bed time  of finishing
his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers 
was a circumstance to strike him deeply <end>  a man who had been in motion
since eight o clock in the morning  and might now have been still 
who had been long talking  and might have been silent  who had been
in more than one crowd  and might have been alone   such a man 
to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside 
and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into
the world   could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken
back his wife  there would have been a motive  but his coming would
probably prolong rather than break up the party <end>  john knightley
looked at him with amazement  then shrugged his shoulders  and said 
 i could not have believed it even of  him  <end> 

mr <end> weston meanwhile  perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation
he was exciting  happy and cheerful as usual  and with all
the right of being principal talker  which a day spent anywhere
from home confers  was making himself agreeable among the rest 
and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner 
convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants
had been forgotten  and spread abroad what public news he had heard 
was proceeding to a family communication  which  though principally
addressed to mrs <end> weston  he had not the smallest doubt of being
highly interesting to every body in the room <end>  he gave her a letter 
it was from frank  and to herself  he had met with it in his way 
and had taken the liberty of opening it <end>

 read it  read it   said he   it will give you pleasure 
only a few lines  will not take you long  read it to emma <end> 

the two ladies looked over it together  and he sat smiling
and talking to them the whole time  in a voice a little subdued 
but very audible to every body <end>

 well  he is coming  you see  good news  i think <end>  well  what do
you say to it   i always told you he would be here again soon 
did not i   anne  my dear  did not i always tell you so  and you would
not believe me   in town next week  you see  at the latest  i dare say 
for  she  is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is
to be done  most likely they will be there to morrow or saturday <end>
as to her illness  all nothing of course <end>  but it is an excellent
thing to have frank among us again  so near as town <end>  they will stay
a good while when they do come  and he will be half his time with us <end>
this is precisely what i wanted <end>  well  pretty good news  is not it 
have you finished it   has emma read it all   put it up  put it up 
we will have a good talk about it some other time  but it will not
do now <end>  i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a
common way <end> 

mrs <end> weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion <end>
her looks and words had nothing to restrain them <end>  she was happy 
she knew she was happy  and knew she ought to be happy <end>
her congratulations were warm and open  but emma could not speak
so fluently <end>   she  was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings 
and trying to understand the degree of her agitation  which she
rather thought was considerable <end>

mr <end> weston  however  too eager to be very observant  too communicative
to want others to talk  was very well satisfied with what she did say 
and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial
communication of what the whole room must have overheard already <end>

it was well that he took every body s joy for granted  or he
might not have thought either mr <end> woodhouse or mr <end> knightley
particularly delighted <end>  they were the first entitled 
after mrs <end> weston and emma  to be made happy   from them he would
have proceeded to miss fairfax  but she was so deep in conversation
with john knightley  that it would have been too positive
an interruption  and finding himself close to mrs <end> elton  and
her attention disengaged  he necessarily began on the subject with her <end>



chapter xviii


 i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you  
said mr <end> weston <end>

mrs <end> elton  very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended
her by such a hope  smiled most graciously <end>

 you have heard of a certain frank churchill  i presume   he continued  
 and know him to be my son  though he does not bear my name <end> 

 oh  yes  and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance <end>
i am sure mr <end> elton will lose no time in calling on him  and we
shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage <end> 

 you are very obliging <end>  frank will be extremely happy  i am sure <end>  
he is to be in town next week  if not sooner <end>  we have notice of it
in a letter to day <end> i met the letters in my way this morning 
and seeing my son s hand  presumed to open it  though it was not directed
to me  it was to mrs <end> weston <end>  she is his principal correspondent 
i assure you <end>  i hardly ever get a letter <end> 

 and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her   oh   mr <end> weston  
 laughing affectedly  i must protest against that <end>  a most dangerous
precedent indeed   i beg you will not let your neighbours follow
your example <end>  upon my word  if this is what i am to expect 
we married women must begin to exert ourselves   oh   mr <end> weston 
i could not have believed it of you  

 aye  we men are sad fellows <end>  you must take care of yourself 
mrs <end> elton <end>  this letter tells us  it is a short letter  written in
a hurry  merely to give us notice  it tells us that they are all
coming up to town directly  on mrs <end> churchill s account  she has
not been well the whole winter  and thinks enscombe too cold for her  
so they are all to move southward without loss of time <end> 

 indeed   from yorkshire  i think <end>  enscombe is in yorkshire  

 yes  they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london <end>
a considerable journey <end> 

 yes  upon my word  very considerable <end>  sixty five miles farther
than from maple grove to london <end>  but what is distance  mr <end> weston 
to people of large fortune   you would be amazed to hear how my brother 
mr <end> suckling  sometimes flies about <end>  you will hardly believe me  
but twice in one week he and mr <end> bragge went to london and back again
with four horses <end> 

 the evil of the distance from enscombe   said mr <end> weston   is  that
mrs <end> churchill   as   we   understand   has not been able to leave the
sofa for a week together <end>  in frank s last letter she complained 
he said  of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having
both his arm and his uncle s  this  you know  speaks a great degree
of weakness  but now she is so impatient to be in town  that she
means to sleep only two nights on the road <end>  so frank writes word <end>
certainly  delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions 
mrs <end> elton <end>  you must grant me that <end> 

 no  indeed  i shall grant you nothing <end>  i always take the part
of my own sex <end>  i do indeed <end>  i give you notice  you will find me
a formidable antagonist on that point <end>  i always stand up for women  
and i assure you  if you knew how selina feels with respect
to sleeping at an inn  you would not wonder at mrs <end> churchill s
making incredible exertions to avoid it <end>  selina says it is quite
horror to her  and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety <end>
she always travels with her own sheets  an excellent precaution <end>
does mrs <end> churchill do the same  

 depend upon it  mrs <end> churchill does every thing that any other
fine lady ever did <end>  mrs <end> churchill will not be second to any lady
in the land for   

mrs <end> elton eagerly interposed with 

 oh   mr <end> weston  do not mistake me <end>  selina is no fine lady 
i assure you <end>  do not run away with such an idea <end> 

 is not she   then she is no rule for mrs <end> churchill  who is
as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld <end> 

mrs <end> elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly <end>
it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister
was  not  a fine lady  perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence
of it   and she was considering in what way she had best retract 
when mr <end> weston went on <end>

 mrs <end> churchill is not much in my good graces  as you may suspect  
but this is quite between ourselves <end>  she is very fond of frank 
and therefore i would not speak ill of her <end>  besides  she is out of
health now  but  that  indeed  by her own account  she has always been <end>
i would not say so to every body  mrs <end> elton  but i have not much
faith in mrs <end> churchill s illness <end> 

 if she is really ill  why not go to bath  mr <end> weston   to bath 
or to clifton     she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too
cold for her <end>  the fact is  i suppose  that she is tired of enscombe <end>
she has now been a longer time stationary there  than she ever
was before  and she begins to want change <end>  it is a retired place <end>
a fine place  but very retired <end> 

 aye  like maple grove  i dare say <end>  nothing can stand more retired from
the road than maple grove <end>  such an immense plantation all round it 
you seem shut out from every thing  in the most complete retirement <end>  
and mrs <end> churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina
to enjoy that sort of seclusion <end>  or  perhaps she may not have
resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life <end>
i always say a woman cannot have too many resources  and i feel
very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent
of society <end> 

 frank was here in february for a fortnight <end> 

 so i remember to have heard <end>  he will find an  addition  to the
society of highbury when he comes again  that is  if i may presume
to call myself an addition <end>  but perhaps he may never have heard
of there being such a creature in the world <end> 

this was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by 
and mr <end> weston  with a very good grace  immediately exclaimed 

 my dear madam   nobody but yourself could imagine such a
thing possible <end>  not heard of you   i believe mrs <end> weston s
letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs <end> elton <end> 

he had done his duty and could return to his son <end>

 when frank left us   continued he   it was quite uncertain when we
might see him again  which makes this day s news doubly welcome <end>
it has been completely unexpected <end>  that is   i  always had a strong
persuasion he would be here again soon  i was sure something
favourable would turn up  but nobody believed me <end>  he and mrs <end> weston
were both dreadfully desponding <end>   how could he contrive to come 
and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare
him again   and so forth  i always felt that something would happen
in our favour  and so it has  you see <end>  i have observed  mrs <end> elton 
in the course of my life  that if things are going untowardly one month 
they are sure to mend the next <end> 

 very true  mr <end> weston  perfectly true <end>  it is just what i used
to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship 
when  because things did not go quite right  did not proceed with all
the rapidity which suited his feelings  he was apt to be in despair 
and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be  may  before
hymen s saffron robe would be put on for us <end>  oh  the pains i have
been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views 
the carriage  we had disappointments about the carriage   one morning 
i remember  he came to me quite in despair <end> 

she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing  and mr <end> weston instantly
seized the opportunity of going on <end>

 you were mentioning may <end>  may is the very month which mrs <end> churchill
is ordered  or has ordered herself  to spend in some warmer place
than enscombe  in short  to spend in london  so that we have the
agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring  
precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen
for it   days almost at the longest  weather genial and pleasant 
always inviting one out  and never too hot for exercise <end>  when he
was here before  we made the best of it  but there was a good deal
of wet  damp  cheerless weather  there always is in february  you know 
and we could not do half that we intended <end>  now will be the time <end>
this will be complete enjoyment  and i do not know  mrs <end> elton 
whether the uncertainty of our meetings  the sort of constant
expectation there will be of his coming in to day or to morrow 
and at any hour  may not be more friendly to happiness than having
him actually in the house <end>  i think it is so <end>  i think it is the
state of mind which gives most spirit and delight <end>  i hope you
will be pleased with my son  but you must not expect a prodigy <end>
he is generally thought a fine young man  but do not expect a prodigy <end>
mrs <end> weston s partiality for him is very great  and  as you may suppose 
most gratifying to me <end>  she thinks nobody equal to him <end> 

 and i assure you  mr <end> weston  i have very little doubt that my
opinion will be decidedly in his favour <end>  i have heard so much
in praise of mr <end> frank churchill <end>  at the same time it is fair
to observe  that i am one of those who always judge for themselves 
and are by no means implicitly guided by others <end>  i give you notice
that as i find your son  so i shall judge of him <end>  i am no flatterer <end> 

mr <end> weston was musing <end>

 i hope   said he presently   i have not been severe upon poor
mrs <end> churchill <end>  if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice 
but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult
for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish <end>
you cannot be ignorant  mrs <end> elton  of my connexion with the family 
nor of the treatment i have met with  and  between ourselves 
the whole blame of it is to be laid to her <end>  she was the instigator <end>
frank s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her <end>
mr <end> churchill has pride  but his pride is nothing to his wife s 
his is a quiet  indolent  gentlemanlike sort of pride that would
harm nobody  and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome 
but her pride is arrogance and insolence   and what inclines one less
to bear  she has no fair pretence of family or blood <end>  she was nobody
when he married her  barely the daughter of a gentleman  but ever
since her being turned into a churchill she has out churchill d them
all in high and mighty claims   but in herself  i assure you  she is
an upstart <end> 

 only think  well  that must be infinitely provoking   i have quite
a horror of upstarts <end>  maple grove has given me a thorough disgust
to people of that sort  for there is a family in that neighbourhood
who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs
they give themselves   your description of mrs <end> churchill made me
think of them directly <end>  people of the name of tupman  very lately
settled there  and encumbered with many low connexions  but giving
themselves immense airs  and expecting to be on a footing with the old
established families <end>  a year and a half is the very utmost that they can
have lived at west hall  and how they got their fortune nobody knows <end>
they came from birmingham  which is not a place to promise much 
you know  mr <end> weston <end>  one has not great hopes from birmingham <end>
i always say there is something direful in the sound   but nothing
more is positively known of the tupmans  though a good many things
i assure you are suspected  and yet by their manners they evidently
think themselves equal even to my brother  mr <end> suckling  who happens
to be one of their nearest neighbours <end>  it is infinitely too bad <end>
mr <end> suckling  who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove 
and whose father had it before him  i believe  at least  i am
almost sure that old mr <end> suckling had completed the purchase before
his death <end> 

they were interrupted <end>  tea was carrying round  and mr <end> weston 
having said all that he wanted  soon took the opportunity of
walking away <end>

after tea  mr <end> and mrs <end> weston  and mr <end> elton sat down with mr <end> woodhouse
to cards <end>  the remaining five were left to their own powers 
and emma doubted their getting on very well  for mr <end> knightley seemed
little disposed for conversation  mrs <end> elton was wanting notice 
which nobody had inclination to pay  and she was herself
in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent <end>

mr <end> john knightley proved more talkative than his brother <end>
he was to leave them early the next day  and he soon began with  

 well  emma  i do not believe i have any thing more to say about
the boys  but you have your sister s letter  and every thing is
down at full length there we may be sure <end>  my charge would be much
more concise than her s  and probably not much in the same spirit 
all that i have to recommend being comprised in  do not spoil them 
and do not physic them <end> 

 i rather hope to satisfy you both   said emma   for i shall do all
in my power to make them happy  which will be enough for isabella 
and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic <end> 

 and if you find them troublesome  you must send them home again <end> 

 that is very likely <end>  you think so  do not you  

 i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father  
or even may be some encumbrance to you  if your visiting engagements
continue to increase as much as they have done lately <end> 

 increase  

 certainly  you must be sensible that the last half year has made
a great difference in your way of life <end> 

 difference   no indeed i am not <end> 

 there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company
than you used to be <end>  witness this very time <end>  here am i come
down for only one day  and you are engaged with a dinner party   
when did it happen before  or any thing like it   your neighbourhood
is increasing  and you mix more with it <end>  a little while ago 
every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties 
dinners at mr <end> cole s  or balls at the crown <end>  the difference
which randalls  randalls alone makes in your goings on  is very great <end> 

 yes   said his brother quickly   it is randalls that does it all <end> 

 very well  and as randalls  i suppose  is not likely to have less
influence than heretofore  it strikes me as a possible thing  emma 
that henry and john may be sometimes in the way <end>  and if they are 
i only beg you to send them home <end> 

 no   cried mr <end> knightley   that need not be the consequence <end>
let them be sent to donwell <end>  i shall certainly be at leisure <end> 

 upon my word   exclaimed emma   you amuse me   i should like to know
how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being
of the party  and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure
to attend to the little boys <end>  these amazing engagements of mine  
what have they been   dining once with the coles  and having a ball
talked of  which never took place <end>  i can understand you   nodding at
mr <end> john knightley   your good fortune in meeting with so many of
your friends at once here  delights you too much to pass unnoticed <end>
but you   turning to mr <end> knightley   who know how very  very seldom
i am ever two hours from hartfield  why you should foresee such a
series of dissipation for me  i cannot imagine <end>  and as to my dear
little boys  i must say  that if aunt emma has not time for them 
i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley 
who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one  
and who  when he is at home  is either reading to himself or settling
his accounts <end> 

mr <end> knightley seemed to be trying not to smile  and succeeded
without difficulty  upon mrs <end> elton s beginning to talk to him <end>




volume iii



chapter i


a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the
nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill <end>
she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at
all apprehensive or embarrassed  it was for him <end>  her own attachment
had really subsided into a mere nothing  it was not worth thinking of   
but if he  who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love
of the two  were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment
which he had taken away  it would be very distressing <end>  if a separation
of two months should not have cooled him  there were dangers and evils
before her   caution for him and for herself would be necessary <end>
she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again 
and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his <end>

she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration <end>
that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance 
and yet  she could not help rather anticipating something decisive <end>
she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis 
an event  a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state <end>

it was not very long  though rather longer than mr <end> weston had foreseen 
before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchill s
feelings <end>  the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had
been imagined  but he was at highbury very soon afterwards <end>  he rode
down for a couple of hours  he could not yet do more  but as he came
from randalls immediately to hartfield  she could then exercise all
her quick observation  and speedily determine how he was influenced 
and how she must act <end>  they met with the utmost friendliness <end>
there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her <end>
but she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he
had done  of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree <end>
she watched him well <end>  it was a clear thing he was less in love than he
had been <end>  absence  with the conviction probably of her indifference 
had produced this very natural and very desirable effect <end>

he was in high spirits  as ready to talk and laugh as ever  and seemed
delighted to speak of his former visit  and recur to old stories 
and he was not without agitation <end>  it was not in his calmness that
she read his comparative difference <end>  he was not calm  his spirits
were evidently fluttered  there was restlessness about him <end>
lively as he was  it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself 
but what decided her belief on the subject  was his staying only a
quarter of an hour  and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury <end>
 he had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed  
he had not stopped  he would not stop for more than a word  but he
had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call 
and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield  he must hurry off <end> 
she had no doubt as to his being less in love  but neither his
agitated spirits  nor his hurrying away  seemed like a perfect cure 
and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her
returning power  and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself
with her long <end>

this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days <end>
he was often hoping  intending to come  but was always prevented <end>
his aunt could not bear to have him leave her <end>  such was his own account
at randall s <end> if he were quite sincere  if he really tried to come 
it was to be inferred that mrs <end> churchill s removal to london had
been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder <end>
that she was really ill was very certain  he had declared himself
convinced of it  at randalls <end>  though much might be fancy  he could
not doubt  when he looked back  that she was in a weaker state
of health than she had been half a year ago <end>  he did not believe it
to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove 
or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her 
but he could not be prevailed on  by all his father s doubts  to say
that her complaints were merely imaginary  or that she was as strong
as ever <end>

it soon appeared that london was not the place for her <end>  she could
not endure its noise <end>  her nerves were under continual irritation
and suffering  and by the ten days  end  her nephew s letter to
randalls communicated a change of plan <end>  they were going to remove
immediately to richmond <end>  mrs <end> churchill had been recommended
to the medical skill of an eminent person there  and had otherwise
a fancy for the place <end>  a ready furnished house in a favourite
spot was engaged  and much benefit expected from the change <end>

emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement 
and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two
months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends  
for the house was taken for may and june <end>  she was told that now
he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them 
almost as often as he could even wish <end>

emma saw how mr <end> weston understood these joyous prospects <end>  he was
considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered <end>
she hoped it was not so <end>  two months must bring it to the proof <end>

mr <end> weston s own happiness was indisputable <end>  he was quite delighted <end>
it was the very circumstance he could have wished for <end>  now  it would
be really having frank in their neighbourhood <end>  what were nine miles
to a young man   an hour s ride <end>  he would be always coming over <end>
the difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough
to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing
him never <end>  sixteen miles  nay  eighteen  it must be full eighteen
to manchester street  was a serious obstacle <end>  were he ever able
to get away  the day would be spent in coming and returning <end>
there was no comfort in having him in london  he might as well be
at enscombe  but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse <end>
better than nearer 

one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal   
the ball at the crown <end>  it had not been forgotten before  but it had
been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day <end>  now  however 
it was absolutely to be  every preparation was resumed  and very soon
after the churchills had removed to richmond  a few lines from frank 
to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change 
and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty four
hours at any given time  induced them to name as early a day as possible <end>

mr <end> weston s ball was to be a real thing <end>  a very few to morrows
stood between the young people of highbury and happiness <end>

mr <end> woodhouse was resigned <end>  the time of year lightened the evil
to him <end>  may was better for every thing than february <end>  mrs <end> bates
was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield  james had due notice 
and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear
little john would have any thing the matter with them  while dear
emma were gone <end>



chapter ii


no misfortune occurred  again to prevent the ball <end>  the day approached 
the day arrived  and after a morning of some anxious watching 
frank churchill  in all the certainty of his own self  reached randalls
before dinner  and every thing was safe <end>

no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma <end>
the room at the crown was to witness it   but it would be better
than a common meeting in a crowd <end>  mr <end> weston had been so very
earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible
after themselves  for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the
propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came 
that she could not refuse him  and must therefore spend some quiet
interval in the young man s company <end>  she was to convey harriet 
and they drove to the crown in good time  the randalls party just
sufficiently before them <end>

frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch  and though
he did not say much  his eyes declared that he meant to have
a delightful evening <end>  they all walked about together  to see
that every thing was as it should be  and within a few minutes
were joined by the contents of another carriage  which emma
could not hear the sound of at first  without great surprize <end>
 so unreasonably early   she was going to exclaim  but she presently
found that it was a family of old friends  who were coming  like herself 
by particular desire  to help mr <end> weston s judgment  and they were
so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins  who had been
entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness 
on the same errand  that it seemed as if half the company might
soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection <end>

emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which
mr <end> weston depended  and felt  that to be the favourite and
intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes 
was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity <end>
she liked his open manners  but a little less of open heartedness
would have made him a higher character <end>  general benevolence 
but not general friendship  made a man what he ought to be <end>  
she could fancy such a man <end>  the whole party walked about 
and looked  and praised again  and then  having nothing else to do 
formed a sort of half circle round the fire  to observe in their
various modes  till other subjects were started  that  though  may  
a fire in the evening was still very pleasant <end>

emma found that it was not mr <end> weston s fault that the number
of privy councillors was not yet larger <end>  they had stopped
at mrs <end> bates s door to offer the use of their carriage 
but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons <end>

frank was standing by her  but not steadily  there was a restlessness 
which shewed a mind not at ease <end>  he was looking about  he was going
to the door  he was watching for the sound of other carriages   
impatient to begin  or afraid of being always near her <end>

mrs <end> elton was spoken of <end>   i think she must be here soon   said he <end>
 i have a great curiosity to see mrs <end> elton  i have heard so much
of her <end>  it cannot be long  i think  before she comes <end> 

a carriage was heard <end>  he was on the move immediately 
but coming back  said 

 i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her <end>  i have never seen
either mr <end> or mrs <end> elton <end>  i have no business to put myself forward <end> 

mr <end> and mrs <end> elton appeared  and all the smiles and the proprieties passed <end>

 but miss bates and miss fairfax   said mr <end> weston  looking about <end>
 we thought you were to bring them <end> 

the mistake had been slight <end>  the carriage was sent for them now <end>
emma longed to know what frank s first opinion of mrs <end> elton
might be  how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress 
and her smiles of graciousness <end>  he was immediately qualifying
himself to form an opinion  by giving her very proper attention 
after the introduction had passed <end>

in a few minutes the carriage returned <end>  somebody talked of rain <end>  
 i will see that there are umbrellas  sir   said frank to his father 
 miss bates must not be forgotten    and away he went <end>  mr <end> weston
was following  but mrs <end> elton detained him  to gratify him by her
opinion of his son  and so briskly did she begin  that the young
man himself  though by no means moving slowly  could hardly be out
of hearing <end>

 a very fine young man indeed  mr <end> weston <end>  you know i candidly told
you i should form my own opinion  and i am happy to say that i am
extremely pleased with him <end>  you may believe me <end>  i never compliment <end>
i think him a very handsome young man  and his manners are precisely
what i like and approve  so truly the gentleman  without the least
conceit or puppyism <end>  you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies  
quite a horror of them <end>  they were never tolerated at maple grove <end>
neither mr <end> suckling nor me had ever any patience with them  and we
used sometimes to say very cutting things   selina  who is mild almost
to a fault  bore with them much better <end> 

while she talked of his son  mr <end> weston s attention was chained 
but when she got to maple grove  he could recollect that there were
ladies just arriving to be attended to  and with happy smiles must
hurry away <end>

mrs <end> elton turned to mrs <end> weston <end>   i have no doubt of its being
our carriage with miss bates and jane <end>  our coachman and horses are
so extremely expeditious   i believe we drive faster than any body <end>  
what a pleasure it is to send one s carriage for a friend   
i understand you were so kind as to offer  but another time it
will be quite unnecessary <end>  you may be very sure i shall always
take care of  them  <end> 

miss bates and miss fairfax  escorted by the two gentlemen 
walked into the room  and mrs <end> elton seemed to think it as much
her duty as mrs <end> weston s to receive them <end>  her gestures and
movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma 
but her words  every body s words  were soon lost under the
incessant flow of miss bates  who came in talking  and had not
finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted
into the circle at the fire <end>  as the door opened she was heard 

 so very obliging of you   no rain at all <end>  nothing to signify <end>
i do not care for myself <end>  quite thick shoes <end>  and jane declares  
well    as soon as she was within the door  well   this is brilliant
indeed   this is admirable   excellently contrived  upon my word <end>
nothing wanting <end>  could not have imagined it <end>  so well lighted up   
jane  jane  look   did you ever see any thing   oh   mr <end> weston 
you must really have had aladdin s lamp <end>  good mrs <end> stokes
would not know her own room again <end>  i saw her as i came in 
she was standing in the entrance <end>   oh   mrs <end> stokes   said i  
but i had not time for more <end>   she was now met by mrs <end> weston <end>  
 very well  i thank you  ma am <end> i hope you are quite well <end>
very happy to hear it <end>  so afraid you might have a headache   
seeing you pass by so often  and knowing how much trouble you must have <end>
delighted to hear it indeed <end>  ah  dear mrs <end> elton  so obliged
to you for the carriage   excellent time <end>  jane and i quite ready <end>
did not keep the horses a moment <end>  most comfortable carriage <end>  
oh  and i am sure our thanks are due to you  mrs <end> weston  on that score <end>
mrs <end> elton had most kindly sent jane a note  or we should have been <end>  
but two such offers in one day   never were such neighbours <end>
i said to my mother   upon my word  ma am   <end>   thank you  my mother
is remarkably well <end>  gone to mr <end> woodhouse s <end> i made her take
her shawl  for the evenings are not warm  her large new shawl  
mrs <end> dixon s wedding present <end>  so kind of her to think of my mother 
bought at weymouth  you know  mr <end> dixon s choice <end>  there were
three others  jane says  which they hesitated about some time <end>
colonel campbell rather preferred an olive <end>  my dear jane 
are you sure you did not wet your feet   it was but a drop or two 
but i am so afraid   but mr <end> frank churchill was so extremely  
and there was a mat to step upon  i shall never forget his
extreme politeness <end>  oh   mr <end> frank churchill  i must tell you
my mother s spectacles have never been in fault since  the rivet
never came out again <end>  my mother often talks of your good nature <end>
does not she  jane   do not we often talk of mr <end> frank churchill   
ah  here s miss woodhouse <end>  dear miss woodhouse  how do you do   
very well i thank you  quite well <end>  this is meeting quite in fairy land   
such a transformation   must not compliment  i know  eyeing emma
most complacently   that would be rude  but upon my word  miss woodhouse 
you do look  how do you like jane s hair   you are a judge <end>  
she did it all herself <end>  quite wonderful how she does her hair   
no hairdresser from london i think could <end>  ah  dr <end> hughes i declare  
and mrs <end> hughes <end>  must go and speak to dr <end> and mrs <end> hughes for
a moment <end>  how do you do   how do you do   very well  i thank you <end>
this is delightful  is not it   where s dear mr <end> richard   
oh  there he is <end>  don t disturb him <end>  much better employed talking
to the young ladies <end>  how do you do  mr <end> richard   i saw you the
other day as you rode through the town  mrs <end> otway  i protest   
and good mr <end> otway  and miss otway and miss caroline <end>  such a host
of friends   and mr <end> george and mr <end> arthur   how do you do   how do
you all do   quite well  i am much obliged to you <end>  never better <end>  
don t i hear another carriage   who can this be   very likely the
worthy coles <end>  upon my word  this is charming to be standing about
among such friends   and such a noble fire   i am quite roasted <end>
no coffee  i thank you  for me  never take coffee <end>  a little tea
if you please  sir  by and bye   no hurry  oh  here it comes <end>
every thing so good  

frank churchill returned to his station by emma  and as soon as miss
bates was quiet  she found herself necessarily overhearing the
discourse of mrs <end> elton and miss fairfax  who were standing a little
way behind her <end>  he was thoughtful <end>  whether he were overhearing too 
she could not determine <end>  after a good many compliments to jane
on her dress and look  compliments very quietly and properly taken 
mrs <end> elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself  
and it was   how do you like my gown   how do you like my trimming   
how has wright done my hair    with many other relative questions 
all answered with patient politeness <end>  mrs <end> elton then said 
 nobody can think less of dress in general than i do  but upon such
an occasion as this  when every body s eyes are so much upon me 
and in compliment to the westons  who i have no doubt are giving
this ball chiefly to do me honour  i would not wish to be inferior
to others <end>  and i see very few pearls in the room except mine <end>  
so frank churchill is a capital dancer  i understand <end>  we shall see
if our styles suit <end>  a fine young man certainly is frank churchill <end>
i like him very well <end> 

at this moment frank began talking so vigorously  that emma could
not but imagine he had overheard his own praises  and did not want
to hear more   and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while 
till another suspension brought mrs <end> elton s tones again distinctly
forward <end>  mr <end> elton had just joined them  and his wife was exclaiming 

 oh  you have found us out at last  have you  in our seclusion   
i was this moment telling jane  i thought you would begin to be
impatient for tidings of us <end> 

 jane    repeated frank churchill  with a look of surprize and displeasure <end>  
 that is easy  but miss fairfax does not disapprove it  i suppose <end> 

 how do you like mrs <end> elton   said emma in a whisper <end>

 not at all <end> 

 you are ungrateful <end> 

 ungrateful   what do you mean    then changing from a frown to
a smile   no  do not tell me  i do not want to know what you mean <end>  
where is my father   when are we to begin dancing  

emma could hardly understand him  he seemed in an odd humour <end>
he walked off to find his father  but was quickly back again with both
mr <end> and mrs <end> weston <end>  he had met with them in a little perplexity 
which must be laid before emma <end>  it had just occurred to mrs <end> weston
that mrs <end> elton must be asked to begin the ball  that she would
expect it  which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma
that distinction <end>  emma heard the sad truth with fortitude <end>

 and what are we to do for a proper partner for her   said mr <end> weston <end>
 she will think frank ought to ask her <end> 

frank turned instantly to emma  to claim her former promise 
and boasted himself an engaged man  which his father looked his most
perfect approbation of  and it then appeared that mrs <end> weston was
wanting  him  to dance with mrs <end> elton himself  and that their business
was to help to persuade him into it  which was done pretty soon <end>  
mr <end> weston and mrs <end> elton led the way  mr <end> frank churchill and miss
woodhouse followed <end>  emma must submit to stand second to mrs <end> elton 
though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her <end>
it was almost enough to make her think of marrying <end>  mrs <end> elton had
undoubtedly the advantage  at this time  in vanity completely gratified 
for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill  she could
not lose by the change <end>  mr <end> weston might be his son s superior <end>  
in spite of this little rub  however  emma was smiling with enjoyment 
delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming 
and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her <end>  
she was more disturbed by mr <end> knightley s not dancing than by any
thing else <end>  there he was  among the standers by  where he ought not
to be  he ought to be dancing   not classing himself with the husbands 
and fathers  and whist players  who were pretending to feel an interest
in the dance till their rubbers were made up   so young as he looked   
he could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere 
than where he had placed himself <end>  his tall  firm  upright figure 
among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men 
was such as emma felt must draw every body s eyes  and  excepting her
own partner  there was not one among the whole row of young men
who could be compared with him <end>  he moved a few steps nearer 
and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike
a manner  with what natural grace  he must have danced  would he
but take the trouble <end>  whenever she caught his eye  she forced him
to smile  but in general he was looking grave <end>  she wished he could
love a ballroom better  and could like frank churchill better <end>  
he seemed often observing her <end>  she must not flatter herself that he
thought of her dancing  but if he were criticising her behaviour 
she did not feel afraid <end>  there was nothing like flirtation between
her and her partner <end>  they seemed more like cheerful  easy friends 
than lovers <end>  that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done 
was indubitable <end>

the ball proceeded pleasantly <end>  the anxious cares  the incessant
attentions of mrs <end> weston  were not thrown away <end>  every body
seemed happy  and the praise of being a delightful ball 
which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be 
was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this <end>
of very important  very recordable events  it was not more productive
than such meetings usually are <end>  there was one  however  which emma
thought something of <end>  the two last dances before supper were begun 
and harriet had no partner   the only young lady sitting down   
and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers  that how there
could be any one disengaged was the wonder   but emma s wonder
lessened soon afterwards  on seeing mr <end> elton sauntering about <end>
he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided 
she was sure he would not  and she was expecting him every moment to
escape into the card room <end>

escape  however  was not his plan <end>  he came to the part of the room
where the sitters by were collected  spoke to some  and walked about
in front of them  as if to shew his liberty  and his resolution
of maintaining it <end>  he did not omit being sometimes directly
before miss smith  or speaking to those who were close to her <end>  
emma saw it <end>  she was not yet dancing  she was working her way
up from the bottom  and had therefore leisure to look around 
and by only turning her head a little she saw it all <end>  when she was
half way up the set  the whole group were exactly behind her  and she
would no longer allow her eyes to watch  but mr <end> elton was so near 
that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took
place between him and mrs <end> weston  and she perceived that his wife 
who was standing immediately above her  was not only listening also 
but even encouraging him by significant glances <end>  the kind hearted 
gentle mrs <end> weston had left her seat to join him and say   do not
you dance  mr <end> elton   to which his prompt reply was   most readily 
mrs <end> weston  if you will dance with me <end> 

 me   oh  no  i would get you a better partner than myself <end>
i am no dancer <end> 

 if mrs <end> gilbert wishes to dance   said he   i shall have great pleasure 
i am sure  for  though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man 
and that my dancing days are over  it would give me very great
pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs <end> gilbert <end> 

 mrs <end> gilbert does not mean to dance  but there is a young lady
disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing  miss smith <end> 
 miss smith   oh   i had not observed <end>  you are extremely obliging  
and if i were not an old married man <end>  but my dancing days are over 
mrs <end> weston <end>  you will excuse me <end>  any thing else i should be most happy
to do  at your command  but my dancing days are over <end> 

mrs <end> weston said no more  and emma could imagine with what
surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat <end>
this was mr <end> elton  the amiable  obliging  gentle mr <end> elton <end>  
she looked round for a moment  he had joined mr <end> knightley at a
little distance  and was arranging himself for settled conversation 
while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife <end>

she would not look again <end>  her heart was in a glow  and she feared
her face might be as hot <end>

in another moment a happier sight caught her   mr <end> knightley
leading harriet to the set   never had she been more surprized 
seldom more delighted  than at that instant <end>  she was all pleasure
and gratitude  both for harriet and herself  and longed to be
thanking him  and though too distant for speech  her countenance
said much  as soon as she could catch his eye again <end>

his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it 
extremely good  and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky 
if it had not been for the cruel state of things before  and for
the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction
which her happy features announced <end>  it was not thrown away on her 
she bounded higher than ever  flew farther down the middle 
and was in a continual course of smiles <end>

mr <end> elton had retreated into the card room  looking  emma trusted 
very foolish <end>  she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife 
though growing very like her    she  spoke some of her feelings 
by observing audibly to her partner 

 knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith   very goodnatured 
i declare <end> 

supper was announced <end>  the move began  and miss bates might be
heard from that moment  without interruption  till her being
seated at table and taking up her spoon <end>

 jane  jane  my dear jane  where are you   here is your tippet <end>
mrs <end> weston begs you to put on your tippet <end>  she says she is afraid
there will be draughts in the passage  though every thing has
been done  one door nailed up  quantities of matting  my dear jane 
indeed you must <end>  mr <end> churchill  oh  you are too obliging 
how well you put it on   so gratified   excellent dancing indeed   
yes  my dear  i ran home  as i said i should  to help grandmama
to bed  and got back again  and nobody missed me <end>  i set off without
saying a word  just as i told you <end>  grandmama was quite well 
had a charming evening with mr <end> woodhouse  a vast deal of chat 
and backgammon <end>  tea was made downstairs  biscuits and baked apples
and wine before she came away   amazing luck in some of her throws 
and she inquired a great deal about you  how you were amused 
and who were your partners <end>   oh   said i   i shall not forestall jane 
i left her dancing with mr <end> george otway  she will love to tell you
all about it herself to morrow  her first partner was mr <end> elton 
i do not know who will ask her next  perhaps mr <end> william cox <end> 
my dear sir  you are too obliging <end>  is there nobody you would
not rather   i am not helpless <end>  sir  you are most kind <end>  upon my word 
jane on one arm  and me on the other   stop  stop  let us stand
a little back  mrs <end> elton is going  dear mrs <end> elton  how elegant
she looks   beautiful lace   now we all follow in her train <end>
quite the queen of the evening   well  here we are at the passage <end>
two steps  jane  take care of the two steps <end>  oh  no  there is
but one <end>  well  i was persuaded there were two <end>  how very odd 
i was convinced there were two  and there is but one <end>  i never saw any
thing equal to the comfort and style  candles everywhere <end>  i was telling
you of your grandmama  jane   there was a little disappointment <end>  
the baked apples and biscuits  excellent in their way  you know 
but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus
brought in at first  and good mr <end> woodhouse  not thinking the
asparagus quite boiled enough  sent it all out again <end>  now there
is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus  
so she was rather disappointed  but we agreed we would not speak of it
to any body  for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse 
who would be so very much concerned   well  this is brilliant 
i am all amazement  could not have supposed any thing   such
elegance and profusion   i have seen nothing like it since  
well  where shall we sit  where shall we sit   anywhere  so that
jane is not in a draught <end>  where  i  sit is of no consequence <end>
oh  do you recommend this side   well  i am sure  mr <end> churchill  
only it seems too good  but just as you please <end>  what you direct
in this house cannot be wrong <end>  dear jane  how shall we ever
recollect half the dishes for grandmama   soup too   bless me 
i should not be helped so soon  but it smells most excellent  and i
cannot help beginning <end> 

emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr <end> knightley till
after supper  but  when they were all in the ballroom again 
her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked <end>
he was warm in his reprobation of mr <end> elton s conduct  it had been
unpardonable rudeness  and mrs <end> elton s looks also received the due
share of censure <end>

 they aimed at wounding more than harriet   said he <end>   emma  why
is it that they are your enemies  

he looked with smiling penetration  and  on receiving
no answer  added    she  ought not to be angry with you  i suspect 
whatever he may be <end>  to that surmise  you say nothing  of course 
but confess  emma  that you did want him to marry harriet <end> 

 i did   replied emma   and they cannot forgive me <end> 

he shook his head  but there was a smile of indulgence with it 
and he only said 

 i shall not scold you <end>  i leave you to your own reflections <end> 

 can you trust me with such flatterers   does my vain spirit ever
tell me i am wrong  

 not your vain spirit  but your serious spirit <end>  if one leads
you wrong  i am sure the other tells you of it <end> 

 i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr <end> elton <end>
there is a littleness about him which you discovered  and which i
did not   and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet <end>
it was through a series of strange blunders  

 and  in return for your acknowledging so much  i will do you the justice
to say  that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for
himself <end>  harriet smith has some first rate qualities  which mrs <end> elton
is totally without <end>  an unpretending  single minded  artless girl  
infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such
a woman as mrs <end> elton <end>  i found harriet more conversable than i expected <end> 

emma was extremely gratified <end>  they were interrupted by the bustle
of mr <end> weston calling on every body to begin dancing again <end>

 come miss woodhouse  miss otway  miss fairfax  what are you all doing   
come emma  set your companions the example <end>  every body is lazy 
every body is asleep  

 i am ready   said emma   whenever i am wanted <end> 

 whom are you going to dance with   asked mr <end> knightley <end>

she hesitated a moment  and then replied   with you  if you will
ask me <end> 

 will you   said he  offering his hand <end>

 indeed i will <end>  you have shewn that you can dance  and you know we
are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper <end> 

 brother and sister  no  indeed <end> 



chapter iii


this little explanation with mr <end> knightley gave emma considerable
pleasure <end>  it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball 
which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy <end>  she was
extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting
the eltons  and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so
much alike  and his praise of harriet  his concession in her favour 
was peculiarly gratifying <end>  the impertinence of the eltons  which for
a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening  had been
the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions  and she looked
forward to another happy result  the cure of harriet s infatuation <end>  
from harriet s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they
quitted the ballroom  she had strong hopes <end>  it seemed as if her eyes
were suddenly opened  and she were enabled to see that mr <end> elton
was not the superior creature she had believed him <end>  the fever
was over  and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being
quickened again by injurious courtesy <end>  she depended on the evil
feelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed
neglect that could be farther requisite <end>  harriet rational 
frank churchill not too much in love  and mr <end> knightley not
wanting to quarrel with her  how very happy a summer must be before her 

she was not to see frank churchill this morning <end>  he had told
her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping
at hartfield  as he was to be at home by the middle of the day <end>
she did not regret it <end>

having arranged all these matters  looked them through  and put them all
to rights  she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up
for the demands of the two little boys  as well as of their grandpapa 
when the great iron sweep gate opened  and two persons entered
whom she had never less expected to see together  frank churchill 
with harriet leaning on his arm  actually harriet   a moment
sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened <end>
harriet looked white and frightened  and he was trying to cheer her <end>  
the iron gates and the front door were not twenty yards asunder   
they were all three soon in the hall  and harriet immediately sinking
into a chair fainted away <end>

a young lady who faints  must be recovered  questions must be answered 
and surprizes be explained <end>  such events are very interesting 
but the suspense of them cannot last long <end>  a few minutes made emma
acquainted with the whole <end>

miss smith  and miss bickerton  another parlour boarder at
mrs <end> goddard s  who had been also at the ball  had walked out together 
and taken a road  the richmond road  which  though apparently public
enough for safety  had led them into alarm <end>  about half a mile
beyond highbury  making a sudden turn  and deeply shaded by elms
on each side  it became for a considerable stretch very retired 
and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it 
they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them 
on a broader patch of greensward by the side  a party of gipsies <end>
a child on the watch  came towards them to beg  and miss bickerton 
excessively frightened  gave a great scream  and calling on harriet
to follow her  ran up a steep bank  cleared a slight hedge at the top 
and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury <end>
but poor harriet could not follow <end>  she had suffered very much
from cramp after dancing  and her first attempt to mount the bank
brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless  
and in this state  and exceedingly terrified  she had been obliged
to remain <end>

how the trampers might have behaved  had the young ladies been
more courageous  must be doubtful  but such an invitation for attack
could not be resisted  and harriet was soon assailed by half a
dozen children  headed by a stout woman and a great boy  all clamorous 
and impertinent in look  though not absolutely in word <end>  more and
more frightened  she immediately promised them money  and taking out
her purse  gave them a shilling  and begged them not to want more 
or to use her ill <end>  she was then able to walk  though but slowly 
and was moving away  but her terror and her purse were too tempting 
and she was followed  or rather surrounded  by the whole gang 
demanding more <end>

in this state frank churchill had found her  she trembling
and conditioning  they loud and insolent <end>  by a most fortunate
chance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him
to her assistance at this critical moment <end>  the pleasantness
of the morning had induced him to walk forward  and leave his
horses to meet him by another road  a mile or two beyond highbury  
and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before
of miss bates  and to have forgotten to restore them  he had
been obliged to stop at her door  and go in for a few minutes 
he was therefore later than he had intended  and being on foot 
was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them <end>
the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet
was then their own portion <end>  he had left them completely frightened 
and harriet eagerly clinging to him  and hardly able to speak 
had just strength enough to reach hartfield  before her spirits
were quite overcome <end>  it was his idea to bring her to hartfield 
he had thought of no other place <end>

this was the amount of the whole story   of his communication and
of harriet s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech <end>  
he dared not stay longer than to see her well  these several delays
left him not another minute to lose  and emma engaging to give
assurance of her safety to mrs <end> goddard  and notice of there
being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr <end> knightley 
he set off  with all the grateful blessings that she could utter
for her friend and herself <end>

such an adventure as this   a fine young man and a lovely young
woman thrown together in such a way  could hardly fail of suggesting
certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain <end>
so emma thought  at least <end>  could a linguist  could a grammarian 
could even a mathematician have seen what she did  have witnessed their
appearance together  and heard their history of it  without feeling
that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting
to each other   how much more must an imaginist  like herself 
be on fire with speculation and foresight   especially with such
a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made <end>

it was a very extraordinary thing   nothing of the sort had ever
occurred before to any young ladies in the place  within her memory 
no rencontre  no alarm of the kind   and now it had happened
to the very person  and at the very hour  when the other very
person was chancing to pass by to rescue her   it certainly
was very extraordinary   and knowing  as she did  the favourable
state of mind of each at this period  it struck her the more <end>
he was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself 
she just recovering from her mania for mr <end> elton <end>  it seemed as if
every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences <end>
it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly
recommending each to the other <end>

in the few minutes  conversation which she had yet had with him 
while harriet had been partially insensible  he had spoken of her terror 
her naivete  her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm  with a
sensibility amused and delighted  and just at last  after harriet s
own account had been given  he had expressed his indignation
at the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms <end>
every thing was to take its natural course  however  neither impelled
nor assisted <end>  she would not stir a step  nor drop a hint <end>
no  she had had enough of interference <end>  there could be no harm
in a scheme  a mere passive scheme <end>  it was no more than a wish <end>
beyond it she would on no account proceed <end>

emma s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge
of what had passed   aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion 
but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible <end>  within half
an hour it was known all over highbury <end>  it was the very event
to engage those who talk most  the young and the low  and all
the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of
frightful news <end>  the last night s ball seemed lost in the gipsies <end>
poor mr <end> woodhouse trembled as he sat  and  as emma had foreseen 
would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go
beyond the shrubbery again <end>  it was some comfort to him that many
inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse  for his neighbours
knew that he loved to be inquired after   as well as miss smith 
were coming in during the rest of the day  and he had the pleasure
of returning for answer  that they were all very indifferent  
which  though not exactly true  for she was perfectly well 
and harriet not much otherwise  emma would not interfere with <end>
she had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such
a man  for she hardly knew what indisposition was  and if he did not
invent illnesses for her  she could make no figure in a message <end>

the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice  they took
themselves off in a hurry <end>  the young ladies of highbury might have
walked again in safety before their panic began  and the whole
history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma
and her nephews   in her imagination it maintained its ground 
and henry and john were still asking every day for the story of
harriet and the gipsies  and still tenaciously setting her right
if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital <end>



chapter iv


a very few days had passed after this adventure  when harriet came
one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand  and after
sitting down and hesitating  thus began 

 miss woodhouse  if you are at leisure  i have something that i
should like to tell you  a sort of confession to make  and then 
you know  it will be over <end> 

emma was a good deal surprized  but begged her to speak <end>
there was a seriousness in harriet s manner which prepared her 
quite as much as her words  for something more than ordinary <end>

 it is my duty  and i am sure it is my wish   she continued 
 to have no reserves with you on this subject <end>  as i am happily
quite an altered creature in  one   respect   it is very fit that you
should have the satisfaction of knowing it <end>  i do not want to say
more than is necessary  i am too much ashamed of having given way
as i have done  and i dare say you understand me <end> 

 yes   said emma   i hope i do <end> 

 how i could so long a time be fancying myself   <end>  <end>  <end> 
cried harriet  warmly <end>   it seems like madness   i can see nothing
at all extraordinary in him now <end>  i do not care whether i meet
him or not  except that of the two i had rather not see him  
and indeed i would go any distance round to avoid him  but i do
not envy his wife in the least  i neither admire her nor envy her 
as i have done   she is very charming  i dare say  and all that 
but i think her very ill tempered and disagreeable  i shall never forget
her look the other night   however  i assure you  miss woodhouse 
i wish her no evil <end>  no  let them be ever so happy together 
it will not give me another moment s pang   and to convince you
that i have been speaking truth  i am now going to destroy  what i
ought to have destroyed long ago  what i ought never to have kept  
i know that very well  blushing as she spoke  <end>  however  now i
will destroy it all  and it is my particular wish to do it
in your presence  that you may see how rational i am grown <end>
cannot you guess what this parcel holds   said she  with a conscious look <end>

 not the least in the world <end>  did he ever give you any thing  

 no  i cannot call them gifts  but they are things that i have
valued very much <end> 

she held the parcel towards her  and emma read the words  most 
 precious   treasures  on the top <end>  her curiosity was greatly excited <end>
harriet unfolded the parcel  and she looked on with impatience <end>
within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridge ware box 
which harriet opened   it was well lined with the softest cotton 
but  excepting the cotton  emma saw only a small piece of court plaister <end>

 now   said harriet   you  must  recollect <end> 

 no  indeed i do not <end> 

 dear me   i should not have thought it possible you could forget
what passed in this very room about court plaister  one of the very
last times we ever met in it   it was but a very few days before i
had my sore throat  just before mr <end> and mrs <end> john knightley came  
i think the very evening <end>  do not you remember his cutting his finger
with your new penknife  and your recommending court plaister   
but  as you had none about you  and knew i had  you desired
me to supply him  and so i took mine out and cut him a piece 
but it was a great deal too large  and he cut it smaller  and kept
playing some time with what was left  before he gave it back to me <end>
and so then  in my nonsense  i could not help making a treasure of it  
so i put it by never to be used  and looked at it now and then
as a great treat <end> 

 my dearest harriet   cried emma  putting her hand before her face 
and jumping up   you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear <end>
remember it   aye  i remember it all now  all  except your saving
this relic  i knew nothing of that till this moment  but the cutting
the finger  and my recommending court plaister  and saying i had none
about me   oh  my sins  my sins   and i had plenty all the while in
my pocket   one of my senseless tricks   i deserve to be under a
continual blush all the rest of my life <end>  well   sitting down again   
go on  what else  

 and had you really some at hand yourself   i am sure i never
suspected it  you did it so naturally <end> 

 and so you actually put this piece of court plaister by for his sake  
said emma  recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided
between wonder and amusement <end>  and secretly she added to herself 
 lord bless me  when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton
a piece of court plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about 
i never was equal to this <end> 

 here   resumed harriet  turning to her box again   here is
something still more valuable  i mean that  has   been  more valuable 
because this is what did really once belong to him  which the
court plaister never did <end> 

emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure <end>  it was the end
of an old pencil   the part without any lead <end>

 this was really his   said harriet <end>   do not you remember
one morning   no  i dare say you do not <end>  but one morning  i forget
exactly the day  but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before
 that   evening   he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket book 
it was about spruce beer <end> mr <end> knightley had been telling him
something about brewing spruce beer  and he wanted to put it down 
but when he took out his pencil  there was so little lead that he
soon cut it all away  and it would not do  so you lent him another 
and this was left upon the table as good for nothing <end>  but i kept
my eye on it  and  as soon as i dared  caught it up  and never
parted with it again from that moment <end> 

 i do remember it   cried emma   i perfectly remember it <end>  
talking about spruce beer <end>  oh  yes  mr <end> knightley and i both saying we
liked it  and mr <end> elton s seeming resolved to learn to like it too <end>
i perfectly remember it <end>  stop  mr <end> knightley was standing just here 
was not he   i have an idea he was standing just here <end> 

 ah   i do not know <end>  i cannot recollect <end>  it is very odd 
but i cannot recollect <end>  mr <end> elton was sitting here  i remember 
much about where i am now <end>   

 well  go on <end> 

 oh  that s all <end>  i have nothing more to shew you  or to say  
except that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire 
and i wish you to see me do it <end> 

 my poor dear harriet  and have you actually found happiness
in treasuring up these things  

 yes  simpleton as i was   but i am quite ashamed of it now  and wish
i could forget as easily as i can burn them <end>  it was very wrong
of me  you know  to keep any remembrances  after he was married <end>
i knew it was  but had not resolution enough to part with them <end> 

 but  harriet  is it necessary to burn the court plaister   i have
not a word to say for the bit of old pencil  but the court plaister
might be useful <end> 

 i shall be happier to burn it   replied harriet <end>   it has
a disagreeable look to me <end>  i must get rid of every thing <end>  
there it goes  and there is an end  thank heaven  of mr <end> elton <end> 

 and when   thought emma   will there be a beginning of mr <end> churchill  

she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was
already made  and could not but hope that the gipsy  though she had
 told  no fortune  might be proved to have made harriet s <end>  about a
fortnight after the alarm  they came to a sufficient explanation 
and quite undesignedly <end>  emma was not thinking of it at the moment 
which made the information she received more valuable <end>
she merely said  in the course of some trivial chat   well  harriet 
whenever you marry i would advise you to do so and so   and thought
no more of it  till after a minute s silence she heard harriet
say in a very serious tone   i shall never marry <end> 

emma then looked up  and immediately saw how it was  and after a
moment s debate  as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not  replied 

 never marry   this is a new resolution <end> 

 it is one that i shall never change  however <end> 

after another short hesitation   i hope it does not proceed from  
i hope it is not in compliment to mr <end> elton  

 mr <end> elton indeed   cried harriet indignantly <end>   oh  no   and emma
could just catch the words   so superior to mr <end> elton  

she then took a longer time for consideration <end>  should she proceed
no farther   should she let it pass  and seem to suspect nothing   
perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did 
or perhaps if she were totally silent  it might only drive
harriet into asking her to hear too much  and against any thing
like such an unreserve as had been  such an open and frequent
discussion of hopes and chances  she was perfectly resolved <end>  
she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once 
all that she meant to say and know <end>  plain dealing was always best <end>
she had previously determined how far she would proceed 
on any application of the sort  and it would be safer for both 
to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed <end>  
she was decided  and thus spoke  

 harriet  i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning <end>
your resolution  or rather your expectation of never marrying 
results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer 
would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you <end>
is not it so  

 oh   miss woodhouse  believe me i have not the presumption to suppose  
indeed i am not so mad <end>  but it is a pleasure to me to admire him
at a distance  and to think of his infinite superiority to all
the rest of the world  with the gratitude  wonder  and veneration 
which are so proper  in me especially <end> 

 i am not at all surprized at you  harriet <end>  the service he rendered
you was enough to warm your heart <end> 

 service  oh  it was such an inexpressible obligation   
the very recollection of it  and all that i felt at the time  
when i saw him coming  his noble look  and my wretchedness before <end>
such a change   in one moment such a change   from perfect misery
to perfect happiness  

 it is very natural <end>  it is natural  and it is honourable <end>  
yes  honourable  i think  to chuse so well and so gratefully <end>  
but that it will be a fortunate preference is more that i can promise <end>
i do not advise you to give way to it  harriet <end>  i do not by any
means engage for its being returned <end>  consider what you are about <end>
perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can 
at any rate do not let them carry you far  unless you are persuaded
of his liking you <end>  be observant of him <end>  let his behaviour be the
guide of your sensations <end>  i give you this caution now  because i
shall never speak to you again on the subject <end>  i am determined
against all interference <end>  henceforward i know nothing of the matter <end>
let no name ever pass our lips <end>  we were very wrong before 
we will be cautious now <end>  he is your superior  no doubt  and there
do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature 
but yet  harriet  more wonderful things have taken place  there have
been matches of greater disparity <end>  but take care of yourself <end>
i would not have you too sanguine  though  however it may end 
be assured your raising your thoughts to  him   is a mark of good taste
which i shall always know how to value <end> 

harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude <end>
emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing
for her friend <end>  its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind  
and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation <end>



chapter v


in this state of schemes  and hopes  and connivance  june opened
upon hartfield <end>  to highbury in general it brought no material change <end>
the eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings 
and of the use to be made of their barouche landau  and jane fairfax
was still at her grandmother s  and as the return of the campbells
from ireland was again delayed  and august  instead of midsummer 
fixed for it  she was likely to remain there full two months longer 
provided at least she were able to defeat mrs <end> elton s activity
in her service  and save herself from being hurried into a delightful
situation against her will <end>

mr <end> knightley  who  for some reason best known to himself  had certainly
taken an early dislike to frank churchill  was only growing to dislike
him more <end>  he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his
pursuit of emma <end>  that emma was his object appeared indisputable <end>
every thing declared it  his own attentions  his father s hints 
his mother in law s guarded silence  it was all in unison 
words  conduct  discretion  and indiscretion  told the same story <end>
but while so many were devoting him to emma  and emma herself making him
over to harriet  mr <end> knightley began to suspect him of some inclination
to trifle with jane fairfax <end>  he could not understand it  but there
were symptoms of intelligence between them  he thought so at least  
symptoms of admiration on his side  which  having once observed 
he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning 
however he might wish to escape any of emma s errors of imagination <end>
 she  was not present when the suspicion first arose <end>  he was dining
with the randalls family  and jane  at the eltons   and he had
seen a look  more than a single look  at miss fairfax  which 
from the admirer of miss woodhouse  seemed somewhat out of place <end>
when he was again in their company  he could not help remembering
what he had seen  nor could he avoid observations which  unless it
were like cowper and his fire at twilight 

 myself creating what i saw  

brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something
of private liking  of private understanding even  between frank
churchill and jane <end>

he had walked up one day after dinner  as he very often did 
to spend his evening at hartfield <end>  emma and harriet were going
to walk  he joined them  and  on returning  they fell in with a
larger party  who  like themselves  judged it wisest to take their
exercise early  as the weather threatened rain  mr <end> and mrs <end> weston
and their son  miss bates and her niece  who had accidentally met <end>
they all united  and  on reaching hartfield gates  emma  who knew it
was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father 
pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him <end>  the randalls
party agreed to it immediately  and after a pretty long speech
from miss bates  which few persons listened to  she also found it
possible to accept dear miss woodhouse s most obliging invitation <end>

as they were turning into the grounds  mr <end> perry passed by on horseback <end>
the gentlemen spoke of his horse <end>

 by the bye   said frank churchill to mrs <end> weston presently 
 what became of mr <end> perry s plan of setting up his carriage  

mrs <end> weston looked surprized  and said   i did not know that he
ever had any such plan <end> 

 nay  i had it from you <end>  you wrote me word of it three months ago <end> 

 me  impossible  

 indeed you did <end>  i remember it perfectly <end>  you mentioned it as
what was certainly to be very soon <end>  mrs <end> perry had told somebody 
and was extremely happy about it <end>  it was owing to  her  persuasion 
as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal
of harm <end>  you must remember it now  

 upon my word i never heard of it till this moment <end> 

 never  really  never   bless me  how could it be   then i must
have dreamt it  but i was completely persuaded  miss smith 
you walk as if you were tired <end>  you will not be sorry to find
yourself at home <end> 

 what is this   what is this   cried mr <end> weston   about perry
and a carriage   is perry going to set up his carriage  frank 
i am glad he can afford it <end>  you had it from himself  had you  

 no  sir   replied his son  laughing   i seem to have had it
from nobody <end>  very odd   i really was persuaded of mrs <end> weston s
having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe  many weeks ago 
with all these particulars  but as she declares she never heard
a syllable of it before  of course it must have been a dream <end>  i am
a great dreamer <end>  i dream of every body at highbury when i am away  
and when i have gone through my particular friends  then i begin
dreaming of mr <end> and mrs <end> perry <end> 

 it is odd though   observed his father   that you should have had such
a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you
should be thinking of at enscombe <end>  perry s setting up his carriage 
and his wife s persuading him to it  out of care for his health  
just what will happen  i have no doubt  some time or other 
only a little premature <end>  what an air of probability sometimes
runs through a dream   and at others  what a heap of absurdities
it is   well  frank  your dream certainly shews that highbury is in
your thoughts when you are absent <end>  emma  you are a great dreamer 
i think  

emma was out of hearing <end>  she had hurried on before her guests
to prepare her father for their appearance  and was beyond the reach
of mr <end> weston s hint <end>

 why  to own the truth   cried miss bates  who had been trying in vain
to be heard the last two minutes   if i must speak on this subject 
there is no denying that mr <end> frank churchill might have  i do not
mean to say that he did not dream it  i am sure i have sometimes
the oddest dreams in the world  but if i am questioned about it 
i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring 
for mrs <end> perry herself mentioned it to my mother  and the coles
knew of it as well as ourselves  but it was quite a secret 
known to nobody else  and only thought of about three days <end>
mrs <end> perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage  and came
to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she
had prevailed <end>  jane  don t you remember grandmama s telling us
of it when we got home   i forget where we had been walking to  
very likely to randalls  yes  i think it was to randalls <end>
mrs <end> perry was always particularly fond of my mother  indeed i do
not know who is not  and she had mentioned it to her in confidence 
she had no objection to her telling us  of course  but it was not
to go beyond   and  from that day to this  i never mentioned it
to a soul that i know of <end>  at the same time  i will not positively
answer for my having never dropt a hint  because i know i do
sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware <end>  i am a talker 
you know  i am rather a talker  and now and then i have let a thing
escape me which i should not <end>  i am not like jane  i wish i were <end>
i will answer for it  she  never betrayed the least thing in the world <end>
where is she   oh  just behind <end>  perfectly remember mrs <end> perry s coming <end>  
extraordinary dream  indeed  

they were entering the hall <end>  mr <end> knightley s eyes had preceded
miss bates s in a glance at jane <end>  from frank churchill s face 
where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away 
he had involuntarily turned to hers  but she was indeed behind 
and too busy with her shawl <end>  mr <end> weston had walked in <end>  the two
other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass <end>  mr <end> knightley
suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye  
he seemed watching her intently  in vain  however  if it were so  
jane passed between them into the hall  and looked at neither <end>

there was no time for farther remark or explanation <end>  the dream must
be borne with  and mr <end> knightley must take his seat with the rest round
the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield 
and which none but emma could have had power to place there and
persuade her father to use  instead of the small sized pembroke 
on which two of his daily meals had  for forty years been crowded <end>
tea passed pleasantly  and nobody seemed in a hurry to move <end>

 miss woodhouse   said frank churchill  after examining a table
behind him  which he could reach as he sat   have your nephews taken
away their alphabets  their box of letters   it used to stand here <end>
where is it   this is a sort of dull looking evening  that ought
to be treated rather as winter than summer <end>  we had great amusement
with those letters one morning <end>  i want to puzzle you again <end> 

emma was pleased with the thought  and producing the box  the table
was quickly scattered over with alphabets  which no one seemed so much
disposed to employ as their two selves <end>  they were rapidly forming
words for each other  or for any body else who would be puzzled <end>
the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for
mr <end> woodhouse  who had often been distressed by the more animated sort 
which mr <end> weston had occasionally introduced  and who now sat happily
occupied in lamenting  with tender melancholy  over the departure
of the  poor little boys   or in fondly pointing out  as he took
up any stray letter near him  how beautifully emma had written it <end>

frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax <end>  she gave
a slight glance round the table  and applied herself to it <end>
frank was next to emma  jane opposite to them  and mr <end> knightley
so placed as to see them all  and it was his object to see as much
as he could  with as little apparent observation <end>  the word
was discovered  and with a faint smile pushed away <end>  if meant
to be immediately mixed with the others  and buried from sight 
she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across 
for it was not mixed  and harriet  eager after every fresh word 
and finding out none  directly took it up  and fell to work <end>
she was sitting by mr <end> knightley  and turned to him for help <end>
the word was  blunder   and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it 
there was a blush on jane s cheek which gave it a meaning not
otherwise ostensible <end>  mr <end> knightley connected it with the dream 
but how it could all be  was beyond his comprehension <end>
how the delicacy  the discretion of his favourite could have been
so lain asleep   he feared there must be some decided involvement <end>
disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn <end>
these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick <end>
it was a child s play  chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank
churchill s part <end>

with great indignation did he continue to observe him  with great
alarm and distrust  to observe also his two blinded companions <end>
he saw a short word prepared for emma  and given to her with a look
sly and demure <end>  he saw that emma had soon made it out  and found
it highly entertaining  though it was something which she judged it
proper to appear to censure  for she said   nonsense  for shame  
he heard frank churchill next say  with a glance towards jane 
 i will give it to her  shall i    and as clearly heard emma
opposing it with eager laughing warmth <end>   no  no  you must not 
you shall not  indeed <end> 

it was done however <end>  this gallant young man  who seemed to love
without feeling  and to recommend himself without complaisance 
directly handed over the word to miss fairfax  and with a particular
degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it <end>  mr <end> knightley s
excessive curiosity to know what this word might be  made him seize
every possible moment for darting his eye towards it  and it was
not long before he saw it to be  dixon  <end>  jane fairfax s perception
seemed to accompany his  her comprehension was certainly more equal
to the covert meaning  the superior intelligence  of those five letters
so arranged <end>  she was evidently displeased  looked up  and seeing
herself watched  blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her 
and saying only   i did not know that proper names were allowed  
pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit  and looked
resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered <end>
her face was averted from those who had made the attack  and turned
towards her aunt <end>

 aye  very true  my dear   cried the latter  though jane had not
spoken a word   i was just going to say the same thing <end>  it is time
for us to be going indeed <end>  the evening is closing in  and grandmama
will be looking for us <end>  my dear sir  you are too obliging <end>
we really must wish you good night <end> 

jane s alertness in moving  proved her as ready as her aunt
had preconceived <end>  she was immediately up  and wanting to quit
the table  but so many were also moving  that she could not get away 
and mr <end> knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously
pushed towards her  and resolutely swept away by her unexamined <end>
she was afterwards looking for her shawl  frank churchill was
looking also  it was growing dusk  and the room was in confusion 
and how they parted  mr <end> knightley could not tell <end>

he remained at hartfield after all the rest  his thoughts full
of what he had seen  so full  that when the candles came to assist
his observations  he must  yes  he certainly must  as a friend  
an anxious friend  give emma some hint  ask her some question <end>
he could not see her in a situation of such danger  without trying to
preserve her <end>  it was his duty <end>

 pray  emma   said he   may i ask in what lay the great amusement 
the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax 
i saw the word  and am curious to know how it could be so very
entertaining to the one  and so very distressing to the other <end> 

emma was extremely confused <end>  she could not endure to give him the
true explanation  for though her suspicions were by no means removed 
she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them <end>

 oh   she cried in evident embarrassment   it all meant nothing 
a mere joke among ourselves <end> 

 the joke   he replied gravely   seemed confined to you
and mr <end> churchill <end> 

he had hoped she would speak again  but she did not <end>  she would
rather busy herself about any thing than speak <end>  he sat a little
while in doubt <end>  a variety of evils crossed his mind <end>  interference  
fruitless interference <end>  emma s confusion  and the acknowledged intimacy 
seemed to declare her affection engaged <end>  yet he would speak <end>
he owed it to her  to risk any thing that might be involved in
an unwelcome interference  rather than her welfare  to encounter
any thing  rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause <end>

 my dear emma   said he at last  with earnest kindness   do you
think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between
the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of  

 between mr <end> frank churchill and miss fairfax   oh  yes  perfectly <end>  
why do you make a doubt of it  

 have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her 
or that she admired him  

 never  never   she cried with a most open eagerness   never  for
the twentieth part of a moment  did such an idea occur to me <end>
and how could it possibly come into your head  

 i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them  
certain expressive looks  which i did not believe meant to be public <end> 

 oh  you amuse me excessively <end>  i am delighted to find that you
can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander  but it will not do  
very sorry to check you in your first essay  but indeed it will
not do <end>  there is no admiration between them  i do assure you 
and the appearances which have caught you  have arisen from some
peculiar circumstances  feelings rather of a totally different nature  
it is impossible exactly to explain   there is a good deal of
nonsense in it  but the part which is capable of being communicated 
which is sense  is  that they are as far from any attachment or
admiration for one another  as any two beings in the world can be <end>
that is  i  presume  it to be so on her side  and i can  answer  for its
being so on his <end>  i will answer for the gentleman s indifference <end> 

she spoke with a confidence which staggered  with a satisfaction
which silenced  mr <end> knightley <end>  she was in gay spirits  and would
have prolonged the conversation  wanting to hear the particulars
of his suspicions  every look described  and all the wheres and hows
of a circumstance which highly entertained her   but his gaiety did
not meet hers <end>  he found he could not be useful  and his feelings
were too much irritated for talking <end>  that he might not be irritated
into an absolute fever  by the fire which mr <end> woodhouse s tender
habits required almost every evening throughout the year  he soon
afterwards took a hasty leave  and walked home to the coolness
and solitude of donwell abbey <end>



chapter vi


after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr <end> and
mrs <end> suckling  the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification
of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn <end>
no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores
at present <end>  in the daily interchange of news  they must be again
restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings 
coming had been united  such as the last accounts of mrs <end> churchill 
whose health seemed every day to supply a different report 
and the situation of mrs <end> weston  whose happiness it was to be hoped
might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child 
as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it <end>

mrs <end> elton was very much disappointed <end>  it was the delay of a great
deal of pleasure and parade <end>  her introductions and recommendations
must all wait  and every projected party be still only talked of <end>
so she thought at first   but a little consideration convinced
her that every thing need not be put off <end>  why should not they
explore to box hill though the sucklings did not come   they could
go there again with them in the autumn <end>  it was settled that they
should go to box hill <end>  that there was to be such a party had been
long generally known   it had even given the idea of another <end>
emma had never been to box hill  she wished to see what every body
found so well worth seeing  and she and mr <end> weston had agreed
to chuse some fine morning and drive thither <end>  two or three more
of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them  and it was to
be done in a quiet  unpretending  elegant way  infinitely superior
to the bustle and preparation  the regular eating and drinking 
and picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings <end>

this was so very well understood between them  that emma could
not but feel some surprise  and a little displeasure  on hearing
from mr <end> weston that he had been proposing to mrs <end> elton  as her
brother and sister had failed her  that the two parties should unite 
and go together  and that as mrs <end> elton had very readily acceded
to it  so it was to be  if she had no objection <end>  now  as her
objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs <end> elton 
of which mr <end> weston must already be perfectly aware  it was not worth
bringing forward again   it could not be done without a reproof
to him  which would be giving pain to his wife  and she found
herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she
would have done a great deal to avoid  an arrangement which would
probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of
mrs <end> elton s party   every feeling was offended  and the forbearance
of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity
in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr <end> weston s temper <end>

 i am glad you approve of what i have done   said he very comfortably <end>
 but i thought you would <end>  such schemes as these are nothing
without numbers <end>  one cannot have too large a party <end>  a large party
secures its own amusement <end>  and she is a good natured woman after all <end>
one could not leave her out <end> 

emma denied none of it aloud  and agreed to none of it in private <end>

it was now the middle of june  and the weather fine  and mrs <end> elton
was growing impatient to name the day  and settle with mr <end> weston
as to pigeon pies and cold lamb  when a lame carriage horse threw
every thing into sad uncertainty <end>  it might be weeks  it might be
only a few days  before the horse were useable  but no preparations
could be ventured on  and it was all melancholy stagnation <end>
mrs <end> elton s resources were inadequate to such an attack <end>

 is not this most vexations  knightley   she cried <end>   and such weather
for exploring   these delays and disappointments are quite odious <end>
what are we to do   the year will wear away at this rate 
and nothing done <end>  before this time last year i assure you we had
had a delightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston <end> 

 you had better explore to donwell   replied mr <end> knightley <end>
 that may be done without horses <end>  come  and eat my strawberries <end>
they are ripening fast <end> 

if mr <end> knightley did not begin seriously  he was obliged to proceed so 
for his proposal was caught at with delight  and the  oh   i should
like it of all things   was not plainer in words than manner <end>
donwell was famous for its strawberry beds  which seemed a plea for
the invitation   but no plea was necessary  cabbage beds would have
been enough to tempt the lady  who only wanted to be going somewhere <end>
she promised him again and again to come  much oftener than
he doubted  and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy 
such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it <end>

 you may depend upon me   said she <end>   i certainly will come <end>
name your day  and i will come <end>  you will allow me to bring
jane fairfax  

 i cannot name a day   said he   till i have spoken to some others
whom i would wish to meet you <end> 

 oh  leave all that to me <end>  only give me a carte blanche <end>  i am
lady patroness  you know <end>  it is my party <end>  i will bring friends
with me <end> 

 i hope you will bring elton   said he    but i will not trouble
you to give any other invitations <end> 

 oh  now you are looking very sly <end>  but consider  you need not be afraid
of delegating power to  me  <end>  i am no young lady on her preferment <end>
married women  you know  may be safely authorised <end>  it is my party <end>
leave it all to me <end>  i will invite your guests <end> 

 no    he calmly replied    there is but one married woman in the world
whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell 
and that one is   

   mrs <end> weston  i suppose   interrupted mrs <end> elton  rather mortified <end>

 no  mrs <end> knightley   and till she is in being  i will manage
such matters myself <end> 

 ah  you are an odd creature   she cried  satisfied to have no
one preferred to herself <end>   you are a humourist  and may say what
you like <end>  quite a humourist <end>  well  i shall bring jane with me  
jane and her aunt <end>  the rest i leave to you <end>  i have no objections
at all to meeting the hartfield family <end>  don t scruple <end>  i know
you are attached to them <end> 

 you certainly will meet them if i can prevail  and i shall call
on miss bates in my way home <end> 

 that s quite unnecessary  i see jane every day   but as you like <end>
it is to be a morning scheme  you know  knightley  quite a simple thing <end>
i shall wear a large bonnet  and bring one of my little baskets
hanging on my arm <end>  here   probably this basket with pink ribbon <end>
nothing can be more simple  you see <end>  and jane will have such another <end>
there is to be no form or parade  a sort of gipsy party <end>  we are
to walk about your gardens  and gather the strawberries ourselves 
and sit under trees   and whatever else you may like to provide 
it is to be all out of doors  a table spread in the shade  you know <end>
every thing as natural and simple as possible <end>  is not that your idea  

 not quite <end>  my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have
the table spread in the dining room <end> the nature and the simplicity
of gentlemen and ladies  with their servants and furniture  i think
is best observed by meals within doors <end>  when you are tired of eating
strawberries in the garden  there shall be cold meat in the house <end> 

 well  as you please  only don t have a great set out <end>  and  by the bye 
can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion   
pray be sincere  knightley <end>  if you wish me to talk to mrs <end> hodges 
or to inspect anything   

 i have not the least wish for it  i thank you <end> 

 well  but if any difficulties should arise  my housekeeper
is extremely clever <end> 

 i will answer for it  that mine thinks herself full as clever 
and would spurn any body s assistance <end> 

 i wish we had a donkey <end>  the thing would be for us all to come
on donkeys  jane  miss bates  and me  and my caro sposo walking by <end>
i really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey <end>  in a country
life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary  for  let a woman have
ever so many resources  it is not possible for her to be always shut
up at home   and very long walks  you know  in summer there is dust 
and in winter there is dirt <end> 

 you will not find either  between donwell and highbury <end>
donwell lane is never dusty  and now it is perfectly dry <end>  come on
a donkey  however  if you prefer it <end>  you can borrow mrs <end> cole s <end>
i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible <end> 

 that i am sure you would <end>  indeed i do you justice  my good friend <end>
under that peculiar sort of dry  blunt manner  i know you have the
warmest heart <end>  as i tell mr <end> e <end>  you are a thorough humourist <end>  
yes  believe me  knightley  i am fully sensible of your attention
to me in the whole of this scheme <end>  you have hit upon the very thing
to please me <end> 

mr <end> knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade <end>
he wished to persuade mr <end> woodhouse  as well as emma  to join the party 
and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors
to eat would inevitably make him ill <end>  mr <end> woodhouse must not 
under the specious pretence of a morning drive  and an hour or two
spent at donwell  be tempted away to his misery <end>

he was invited on good faith <end>  no lurking horrors were to upbraid
him for his easy credulity <end>  he did consent <end>  he had not been
at donwell for two years <end>   some very fine morning  he  and emma 
and harriet  could go very well  and he could sit still with
mrs <end> weston  while the dear girls walked about the gardens <end>
he did not suppose they could be damp now  in the middle of
the day <end>  he should like to see the old house again exceedingly 
and should be very happy to meet mr <end> and mrs <end> elton  and any other
of his neighbours <end>  he could not see any objection at all to his 
and emma s  and harriet s going there some very fine morning <end>
he thought it very well done of mr <end> knightley to invite them  
very kind and sensible  much cleverer than dining out <end>  he was not
fond of dining out <end> 

mr <end> knightley was fortunate in every body s most ready concurrence <end>
the invitation was everywhere so well received  that it seemed as if 
like mrs <end> elton  they were all taking the scheme as a particular
compliment to themselves <end>  emma and harriet professed very high
expectations of pleasure from it  and mr <end> weston  unasked 
promised to get frank over to join them  if possible  a proof
of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with <end>  
mr <end> knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad
to see him  and mr <end> weston engaged to lose no time in writing 
and spare no arguments to induce him to come <end>

in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast  that the party
to box hill was again under happy consideration  and at last donwell
was settled for one day  and box hill for the next   the weather
appearing exactly right <end>

under a bright mid day sun  at almost midsummer  mr <end> woodhouse
was safely conveyed in his carriage  with one window down 
to partake of this al fresco party  and in one of the most
comfortable rooms in the abbey  especially prepared for him by a
fire all the morning  he was happily placed  quite at his ease 
ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved  and advise
every body to come and sit down  and not to heat themselves <end>  
mrs <end> weston  who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired 
and sit all the time with him  remained  when all the others
were invited or persuaded out  his patient listener and sympathiser <end>

it was so long since emma had been at the abbey  that as soon as she
was satisfied of her father s comfort  she was glad to leave him 
and look around her  eager to refresh and correct her memory with
more particular observation  more exact understanding of a house
and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family <end>

she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance
with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant 
as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building 
its suitable  becoming  characteristic situation  low and sheltered  
its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream 
of which the abbey  with all the old neglect of prospect 
had scarcely a sight  and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues 
which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up <end>  the house
was larger than hartfield  and totally unlike it  covering a good
deal of ground  rambling and irregular  with many comfortable 
and one or two handsome rooms <end>  it was just what it ought to be 
and it looked what it was  and emma felt an increasing respect
for it  as the residence of a family of such true gentility 
untainted in blood and understanding <end>  some faults of temper john
knightley had  but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably <end>
she had given them neither men  nor names  nor places  that could
raise a blush <end>  these were pleasant feelings  and she walked about
and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did 
and collect round the strawberry beds <end>  the whole party were assembled 
excepting frank churchill  who was expected every moment from richmond 
and mrs <end> elton  in all her apparatus of happiness  her large bonnet
and her basket  was very ready to lead the way in gathering 
accepting  or talking  strawberries  and only strawberries 
could now be thought or spoken of <end>   the best fruit in england  
every body s favourite  always wholesome <end>  these the finest beds
and finest sorts <end>  delightful to gather for one s self  the only way
of really enjoying them <end>  morning decidedly the best time  never tired  
every sort good  hautboy infinitely superior  no comparison  
the others hardly eatable  hautboys very scarce  chili preferred  
white wood finest flavour of all  price of strawberries in london  
abundance about bristol  maple grove  cultivation  beds when to
be renewed  gardeners thinking exactly different  no general rule  
gardeners never to be put out of their way  delicious fruit  
only too rich to be eaten much of  inferior to cherries  
currants more refreshing  only objection to gathering strawberries
the stooping  glaring sun  tired to death  could bear it no longer  
must go and sit in the shade <end> 

such  for half an hour  was the conversation  interrupted only
once by mrs <end> weston  who came out  in her solicitude after her
son in law  to inquire if he were come  and she was a little uneasy <end>  
she had some fears of his horse <end>

seats tolerably in the shade were found  and now emma was obliged
to overhear what mrs <end> elton and jane fairfax were talking of <end>  
a situation  a most desirable situation  was in question <end>  mrs <end> elton
had received notice of it that morning  and was in raptures <end>
it was not with mrs <end> suckling  it was not with mrs <end> bragge 
but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them   it was
with a cousin of mrs <end> bragge  an acquaintance of mrs <end> suckling 
a lady known at maple grove <end>  delightful  charming  superior 
first circles  spheres  lines  ranks  every thing  and mrs <end> elton
was wild to have the offer closed with immediately <end>  on her side 
all was warmth  energy  and triumph  and she positively refused
to take her friend s negative  though miss fairfax continued
to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing 
repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before <end>  
still mrs <end> elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence
by the morrow s post <end>  how jane could bear it at all  was astonishing
to emma <end>  she did look vexed  she did speak pointedly  and at last 
with a decision of action unusual to her  proposed a removal <end>  
 should not they walk   would not mr <end> knightley shew them the gardens  
all the gardens   she wished to see the whole extent <end>   the pertinacity
of her friend seemed more than she could bear <end>

it was hot  and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered 
dispersed way  scarcely any three together  they insensibly
followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short
avenue of limes  which stretching beyond the garden at an equal
distance from the river  seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds <end>  
it led to nothing  nothing but a view at the end over a low stone
wall with high pillars  which seemed intended  in their erection 
to give the appearance of an approach to the house  which never had
been there <end>  disputable  however  as might be the taste of such
a termination  it was in itself a charming walk  and the view
which closed it extremely pretty <end>  the considerable slope  at nearly
the foot of which the abbey stood  gradually acquired a steeper
form beyond its grounds  and at half a mile distant was a bank
of considerable abruptness and grandeur  well clothed with wood   
and at the bottom of this bank  favourably placed and sheltered 
rose the abbey mill farm  with meadows in front  and the river
making a close and handsome curve around it <end>

it was a sweet view  sweet to the eye and the mind <end>  english verdure 
english culture  english comfort  seen under a sun bright 
without being oppressive <end>

in this walk emma and mr <end> weston found all the others assembled 
and towards this view she immediately perceived mr <end> knightley
and harriet distinct from the rest  quietly leading the way <end>
mr <end> knightley and harriet   it was an odd tete a tete  but she was
glad to see it <end>  there had been a time when he would have scorned
her as a companion  and turned from her with little ceremony <end>
now they seemed in pleasant conversation <end>  there had been a time
also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot
so favourable for the abbey mill farm  but now she feared it not <end>
it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity
and beauty  its rich pastures  spreading flocks  orchard in blossom 
and light column of smoke ascending <end>  she joined them at the wall 
and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around <end>
he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture  etc <end>
and emma received a smile which seemed to say   these are my
own concerns <end>  i have a right to talk on such subjects  without being
suspected of introducing robert martin <end>   she did not suspect him <end>
it was too old a story <end>  robert martin had probably ceased to think
of harriet <end>  they took a few turns together along the walk <end>  the shade
was most refreshing  and emma found it the pleasantest part of
the day <end>

the next remove was to the house  they must all go in and eat   
and they were all seated and busy  and still frank churchill did
not come <end>  mrs <end> weston looked  and looked in vain <end>  his father would
not own himself uneasy  and laughed at her fears  but she could
not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare <end>
he had expressed himself as to coming  with more than common certainty <end>
 his aunt was so much better  that he had not a doubt of getting
over to them <end>   mrs <end> churchill s state  however  as many were ready
to remind her  was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint
her nephew in the most reasonable dependence  and mrs <end> weston
was at last persuaded to believe  or to say  that it must be
by some attack of mrs <end> churchill that he was prevented coming <end>  
emma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration 
she behaved very well  and betrayed no emotion <end>

the cold repast was over  and the party were to go out once more
to see what had not yet been seen  the old abbey fish ponds 
perhaps get as far as the clover  which was to be begun cutting
on the morrow  or  at any rate  have the pleasure of being hot 
and growing cool again <end>  mr <end> woodhouse  who had already taken
his little round in the highest part of the gardens  where no
damps from the river were imagined even by him  stirred no more 
and his daughter resolved to remain with him  that mrs <end> weston
might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety
which her spirits seemed to need <end>

mr <end> knightley had done all in his power for mr <end> woodhouse s
entertainment <end>  books of engravings  drawers of medals  cameos 
corals  shells  and every other family collection within his cabinets 
had been prepared for his old friend  to while away the morning 
and the kindness had perfectly answered <end>  mr <end> woodhouse had been
exceedingly well amused <end>  mrs <end> weston had been shewing them all to him 
and now he would shew them all to emma   fortunate in having no other
resemblance to a child  than in a total want of taste for what he saw 
for he was slow  constant  and methodical <end>  before this second looking
over was begun  however  emma walked into the hall for the sake
of a few moments  free observation of the entrance and ground plot
of the house  and was hardly there  when jane fairfax appeared 
coming quickly in from the garden  and with a look of escape <end>  
little expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon  there was a start
at first  but miss woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of <end>

 will you be so kind   said she   when i am missed  as to say
that i am gone home   i am going this moment <end>  my aunt is not aware
how late it is  nor how long we have been absent  but i am sure we
shall be wanted  and i am determined to go directly <end>  i have said
nothing about it to any body <end>  it would only be giving trouble
and distress <end>  some are gone to the ponds  and some to the lime walk <end>
till they all come in i shall not be missed  and when they do 
will you have the goodness to say that i am gone  

 certainly  if you wish it   but you are not going to walk
to highbury alone  

 yes  what should hurt me   i walk fast <end>  i shall be at home
in twenty minutes <end> 

 but it is too far  indeed it is  to be walking quite alone <end>
let my father s servant go with you <end>  let me order the carriage <end>
it can be round in five minutes <end> 

 thank you  thank you  but on no account <end>  i would rather walk <end>  
and for  me  to be afraid of walking alone   i  who may so soon have
to guard others  

she spoke with great agitation  and emma very feelingly replied 
 that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now <end>
i must order the carriage <end>  the heat even would be danger <end>  you are
fatigued already <end> 

 i am    she answered   i am fatigued  but it is not the sort
of fatigue  quick walking will refresh me <end>  miss woodhouse  we all
know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits <end>  mine  i confess 
are exhausted <end>  the greatest kindness you can shew me  will be to let
me have my own way  and only say that i am gone when it is necessary <end> 

emma had not another word to oppose <end>  she saw it all  and entering
into her feelings  promoted her quitting the house immediately 
and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend <end>  her parting
look was grateful  and her parting words   oh   miss woodhouse 
the comfort of being sometimes alone    seemed to burst from
an overcharged heart  and to describe somewhat of the continual
endurance to be practised by her  even towards some of those who
loved her best <end>

 such a home  indeed  such an aunt   said emma  as she turned back
into the hall again <end>   i do pity you <end>  and the more sensibility
you betray of their just horrors  the more i shall like you <end> 

jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour  and they had only
accomplished some views of st <end> mark s place  venice  when frank
churchill entered the room <end>  emma had not been thinking of him 
she had forgotten to think of him  but she was very glad to see him <end>
mrs <end> weston would be at ease <end>  the black mare was blameless 
 they  were right who had named mrs <end> churchill as the cause <end>
he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her 
a nervous seizure  which had lasted some hours  and he had quite given
up every thought of coming  till very late   and had he known how hot
a ride he should have  and how late  with all his hurry  he must be 
he believed he should not have come at all <end>  the heat was excessive 
he had never suffered any thing like it  almost wished he had staid
at home  nothing killed him like heat  he could bear any degree of cold 
etc <end>  but heat was intolerable  and he sat down  at the greatest
possible distance from the slight remains of mr <end> woodhouse s fire 
looking very deplorable <end>

 you will soon be cooler  if you sit still   said emma <end>

 as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again <end>  i could very
ill be spared  but such a point had been made of my coming 
you will all be going soon i suppose  the whole party breaking up <end>
i met  one  as i came  madness in such weather   absolute madness  

emma listened  and looked  and soon perceived that frank churchill s
state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being
out of humour <end>  some people were always cross when they were hot <end>
such might be his constitution  and as she knew that eating
and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints 
she recommended his taking some refreshment  he would find abundance
of every thing in the dining room  and she humanely pointed out
the door <end>

 no  he should not eat <end>  he was not hungry  it would only make
him hotter <end>   in two minutes  however  he relented in his own favour 
and muttering something about spruce beer  walked off <end>  emma returned
all her attention to her father  saying in secret  

 i am glad i have done being in love with him <end>  i should not like a
man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning <end>  harriet s sweet
easy temper will not mind it <end> 

he was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal  and came
back all the better  grown quite cool  and  with good manners 
like himself  able to draw a chair close to them  take an interest
in their employment  and regret  in a reasonable way  that he
should be so late <end>  he was not in his best spirits  but seemed
trying to improve them  and  at last  made himself talk nonsense
very agreeably <end>  they were looking over views in swisserland <end>

 as soon as my aunt gets well  i shall go abroad   said he <end>
 i shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places <end>
you will have my sketches  some time or other  to look at  or my tour
to read  or my poem <end>  i shall do something to expose myself <end> 

 that may be  but not by sketches in swisserland <end>  you will
never go to swisserland <end>  your uncle and aunt will never allow
you to leave england <end> 

 they may be induced to go too <end>  a warm climate may be prescribed
for her <end>  i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad <end>
i assure you i have <end>  i feel a strong persuasion  this morning 
that i shall soon be abroad <end>  i ought to travel <end>  i am tired
of doing nothing <end>  i want a change <end>  i am serious  miss woodhouse 
whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy  i am sick of england  
and would leave it to morrow  if i could <end> 

 you are sick of prosperity and indulgence <end>  cannot you invent
a few hardships for yourself  and be contented to stay  

  i  sick of prosperity and indulgence   you are quite mistaken <end>
i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged <end>  i am
thwarted in every thing material <end>  i do not consider myself at all
a fortunate person <end> 

 you are not quite so miserable  though  as when you first came <end>
go and eat and drink a little more  and you will do very well <end>
another slice of cold meat  another draught of madeira and water 
will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us <end> 

 no  i shall not stir <end>  i shall sit by you <end>  you are my best cure <end> 

 we are going to box hill to morrow   you will join us <end>
it is not swisserland  but it will be something for a young
man so much in want of a change <end>  you will stay  and go with us  

 no  certainly not  i shall go home in the cool of the evening <end> 

 but you may come again in the cool of to morrow morning <end> 

 no  it will not be worth while <end>  if i come  i shall be cross <end> 

 then pray stay at richmond <end> 

 but if i do  i shall be crosser still <end>  i can never bear to think
of you all there without me <end> 

 these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself <end>
chuse your own degree of crossness <end>  i shall press you no more <end> 

the rest of the party were now returning  and all were soon collected <end>
with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill 
others took it very composedly  but there was a very general distress
and disturbance on miss fairfax s disappearance being explained <end>
that it was time for every body to go  concluded the subject  and with
a short final arrangement for the next day s scheme  they parted <end>
frank churchill s little inclination to exclude himself increased
so much  that his last words to emma were 

 well   if  you  wish me to stay and join the party  i will <end> 

she smiled her acceptance  and nothing less than a summons from
richmond was to take him back before the following evening <end>



chapter vii


they had a very fine day for box hill  and all the other outward
circumstances of arrangement  accommodation  and punctuality 
were in favour of a pleasant party <end>  mr <end> weston directed the whole 
officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage  and every
body was in good time <end>  emma and harriet went together  miss bates
and her niece  with the eltons  the gentlemen on horseback <end>
mrs <end> weston remained with mr <end> woodhouse <end>  nothing was wanting
but to be happy when they got there <end>  seven miles were travelled
in expectation of enjoyment  and every body had a burst of admiration
on first arriving  but in the general amount of the day there
was deficiency <end>  there was a languor  a want of spirits  a want of union 
which could not be got over <end>  they separated too much into parties <end>
the eltons walked together  mr <end> knightley took charge of miss
bates and jane  and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill <end>
and mr <end> weston tried  in vain  to make them harmonise better <end>  it seemed
at first an accidental division  but it never materially varied <end>
mr <end> and mrs <end> elton  indeed  shewed no unwillingness to mix 
and be as agreeable as they could  but during the two whole hours
that were spent on the hill  there seemed a principle of separation 
between the other parties  too strong for any fine prospects  or any
cold collation  or any cheerful mr <end> weston  to remove <end>

at first it was downright dulness to emma <end>  she had never seen frank
churchill so silent and stupid <end>  he said nothing worth hearing  
looked without seeing  admired without intelligence  listened without
knowing what she said <end>  while he was so dull  it was no wonder that
harriet should be dull likewise  and they were both insufferable <end>

when they all sat down it was better  to her taste a great deal better 
for frank churchill grew talkative and gay  making her his first object <end>
every distinguishing attention that could be paid  was paid to her <end>
to amuse her  and be agreeable in her eyes  seemed all that he
cared for  and emma  glad to be enlivened  not sorry to be flattered 
was gay and easy too  and gave him all the friendly encouragement 
the admission to be gallant  which she had ever given in the first
and most animating period of their acquaintance  but which now 
in her own estimation  meant nothing  though in the judgment of most
people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english
word but flirtation could very well describe <end>   mr <end> frank churchill
and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively <end>   they were laying
themselves open to that very phrase  and to having it sent off
in a letter to maple grove by one lady  to ireland by another <end>
not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity 
it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected <end>
she laughed because she was disappointed  and though she liked him
for his attentions  and thought them all  whether in friendship 
admiration  or playfulness  extremely judicious  they were not winning
back her heart <end>  she still intended him for her friend <end>

 how much i am obliged to you   said he   for telling me to come to day   
if it had not been for you  i should certainly have lost all the
happiness of this party <end>  i had quite determined to go away again <end> 

 yes  you were very cross  and i do not know what about 
except that you were too late for the best strawberries <end>
i was a kinder friend than you deserved <end>  but you were humble <end>
you begged hard to be commanded to come <end> 

 don t say i was cross <end>  i was fatigued <end>  the heat overcame me <end> 

 it is hotter to day <end> 

 not to my feelings <end>  i am perfectly comfortable to day <end> 

 you are comfortable because you are under command <end> 

 your command   yes <end> 

 perhaps i intended you to say so  but i meant self command <end> you had 
somehow or other  broken bounds yesterday  and run away from your
own management  but to day you are got back again  and as i cannot
be always with you  it is best to believe your temper under your
own command rather than mine <end> 

 it comes to the same thing <end>  i can have no self command without
a motive <end>  you order me  whether you speak or not <end>  and you can
be always with me <end>  you are always with me <end> 

 dating from three o clock yesterday <end>  my perpetual influence
could not begin earlier  or you would not have been so much
out of humour before <end> 

 three o clock yesterday   that is your date <end>  i thought i had seen
you first in february <end> 

 your gallantry is really unanswerable <end>  but  lowering her voice   
nobody speaks except ourselves  and it is rather too much to be
talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people <end> 

 i say nothing of which i am ashamed   replied he  with lively impudence <end>
 i saw you first in february <end>  let every body on the hill hear me if
they can <end>  let my accents swell to mickleham on one side  and dorking
on the other <end>  i saw you first in february <end>   and then whispering  
 our companions are excessively stupid <end>  what shall we do to rouse them 
any nonsense will serve <end>  they  shall  talk <end>  ladies and gentlemen 
i am ordered by miss woodhouse  who  wherever she is  presides 
to say  that she desires to know what you are all thinking of  

some laughed  and answered good humouredly <end> miss bates said a great deal 
mrs <end> elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouse s presiding 
mr <end> knightley s answer was the most distinct <end>

 is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are
all thinking of  

 oh  no  no   cried emma  laughing as carelessly as she could  
 upon no account in the world <end>  it is the very last thing i
would stand the brunt of just now <end>  let me hear any thing rather
than what you are all thinking of <end>  i will not say quite all <end>
there are one or two  perhaps   glancing at mr <end> weston and harriet  
whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing <end> 

 it is a sort of thing   cried mrs <end> elton emphatically 
 which  i  should not have thought myself privileged to
inquire into <end>  though  perhaps  as the  chaperon  of the party  
 i  never was in any circle  exploring parties  young ladies  married women   

her mutterings were chiefly to her husband  and he murmured 
in reply 

 very true  my love  very true <end>  exactly so  indeed  quite unheard of  
but some ladies say any thing <end>  better pass it off as a joke <end>
every body knows what is due to  you  <end> 

 it will not do   whispered frank to emma   they are most
of them affronted <end>  i will attack them with more address <end>
ladies and gentlemen  i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say  that she
waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of 
and only requires something very entertaining from each of you 
in a general way <end>  here are seven of you  besides myself   who  she
is pleased to say  am very entertaining already   and she only
demands from each of you either one thing very clever  be it prose
or verse  original or repeated  or two things moderately clever  
or three things very dull indeed  and she engages to laugh heartily
at them all <end> 

 oh  very well   exclaimed miss bates   then i need not be uneasy <end>
 three things very dull indeed <end>   that will just do for me  you know <end>
i shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open
my mouth  shan t i   looking round with the most good humoured
dependence on every body s assent   do not you all think i shall  

emma could not resist <end>

 ah  ma am  but there may be a difficulty <end>  pardon me  but you
will be limited as to number  only three at once <end> 

miss bates  deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner  did not
immediately catch her meaning  but  when it burst on her  it could
not anger  though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her <end>

 ah   well  to be sure <end>  yes  i see what she means   turning to
mr <end> knightley   and i will try to hold my tongue <end>  i must make
myself very disagreeable  or she would not have said such a thing
to an old friend <end> 

 i like your plan   cried mr <end> weston <end>   agreed  agreed <end>  i will do
my best <end>  i am making a conundrum <end>  how will a conundrum reckon  

 low  i am afraid  sir  very low   answered his son    but we shall
be indulgent  especially to any one who leads the way <end> 

 no  no   said emma   it will not reckon low <end>  a conundrum of
mr <end> weston s shall clear him and his next neighbour <end>  come  sir 
pray let me hear it <end> 

 i doubt its being very clever myself   said mr <end> weston <end>
 it is too much a matter of fact  but here it is <end>  what two letters
of the alphabet are there  that express perfection  

 what two letters   express perfection   i am sure i do not know <end> 

 ah  you will never guess <end>  you   to emma   i am certain  will
never guess <end>  i will tell you <end>  m <end> and a <end>  em ma <end>  do you understand  

understanding and gratification came together <end>  it might be a very
indifferent piece of wit  but emma found a great deal to laugh
at and enjoy in it  and so did frank and harriet <end>  it did not seem
to touch the rest of the party equally  some looked very stupid
about it  and mr <end> knightley gravely said 

 this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted  and mr <end> weston
has done very well for himself  but he must have knocked up every
body else <end>   perfection  should not have come quite so soon <end> 

 oh  for myself  i protest i must be excused   said mrs <end> elton 
  i  really cannot attempt  i am not at all fond of the sort of thing <end>
i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name  which i was not
at all pleased with <end>  i knew who it came from <end>  an abominable puppy   
you know who i mean  nodding to her husband  <end> these kind of things
are very well at christmas  when one is sitting round the fire 
but quite out of place  in my opinion  when one is exploring
about the country in summer <end>  miss woodhouse must excuse me <end>
i am not one of those who have witty things at every body s service <end>
i do not pretend to be a wit <end>  i have a great deal of vivacity
in my own way  but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak
and when to hold my tongue <end>  pass us  if you please  mr <end> churchill <end>
pass mr <end> e <end>  knightley  jane  and myself <end>  we have nothing clever to say  
not one of us <end>

 yes  yes  pray pass  me    added her husband  with a sort of
sneering consciousness    i  have nothing to say that can entertain
miss woodhouse  or any other young lady <end>  an old married man  
quite good for nothing <end>  shall we walk  augusta  

 with all my heart <end>  i am really tired of exploring so long
on one spot <end>  come  jane  take my other arm <end> 

jane declined it  however  and the husband and wife walked off <end>
 happy couple   said frank churchill  as soon as they were out
of hearing    how well they suit one another   very lucky  marrying as
they did  upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place   they only
knew each other  i think  a few weeks in bath   peculiarly lucky   
for as to any real knowledge of a person s disposition that bath 
or any public place  can give  it is all nothing  there can be
no knowledge <end>  it is only by seeing women in their own homes 
among their own set  just as they always are  that you can form
any just judgment <end>  short of that  it is all guess and luck  
and will generally be ill luck <end> how many a man has committed himself
on a short acquaintance  and rued it all the rest of his life  

miss fairfax  who had seldom spoken before  except among her
own confederates  spoke now <end>

 such things do occur  undoubtedly <end>   she was stopped by a cough <end>
frank churchill turned towards her to listen <end>

 you were speaking   said he  gravely <end>  she recovered her voice <end>

 i was only going to observe  that though such unfortunate circumstances
do sometimes occur both to men and women  i cannot imagine them
to be very frequent <end>  a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise  
but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards <end>  i would
be understood to mean  that it can be only weak  irresolute characters 
 whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance  
who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience 
an oppression for ever <end> 

he made no answer  merely looked  and bowed in submission  and soon
afterwards said  in a lively tone 

 well  i have so little confidence in my own judgment  that whenever
i marry  i hope some body will chuse my wife for me <end>  will you 
 turning to emma <end>  will you chuse a wife for me   i am sure i
should like any body fixed on by you <end>  you provide for the family 
you know   with a smile at his father  <end> find some body for me <end>
i am in no hurry <end>  adopt her  educate her <end> 

 and make her like myself <end> 

 by all means  if you can <end> 

 very well <end>  i undertake the commission <end>  you shall have a charming wife <end> 

 she must be very lively  and have hazle eyes <end>  i care for nothing else <end>
i shall go abroad for a couple of years  and when i return 
i shall come to you for my wife <end>  remember <end> 

emma was in no danger of forgetting <end>  it was a commission to touch every
favourite feeling <end>  would not harriet be the very creature described 
hazle eyes excepted  two years more might make her all that he wished <end>
he might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment 
who could say   referring the education to her seemed to imply it <end>

 now  ma am   said jane to her aunt   shall we join mrs <end> elton  

 if you please  my dear <end>  with all my heart <end>  i am quite ready <end>
i was ready to have gone with her  but this will do just as well <end>
we shall soon overtake her <end>  there she is  no  that s somebody else <end>
that s one of the ladies in the irish car party  not at all like her <end>  
well  i declare   

they walked off  followed in half a minute by mr <end> knightley <end>
mr <end> weston  his son  emma  and harriet  only remained  and the young
man s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant <end>  even emma grew
tired at last of flattery and merriment  and wished herself rather
walking quietly about with any of the others  or sitting almost alone 
and quite unattended to  in tranquil observation of the beautiful
views beneath her <end>  the appearance of the servants looking out
for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight 
and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart 
and the solicitude of mrs <end> elton to have  her  carriage first 
were gladly endured  in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was
to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure <end>
such another scheme  composed of so many ill assorted people 
she hoped never to be betrayed into again <end>

while waiting for the carriage  she found mr <end> knightley by her side <end>
he looked around  as if to see that no one were near  and then said 

 emma  i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do 
a privilege rather endured than allowed  perhaps  but i must still
use it <end>  i cannot see you acting wrong  without a remonstrance <end>
how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates   how could you be so
insolent in your wit to a woman of her character  age  and situation   
emma  i had not thought it possible <end> 

emma recollected  blushed  was sorry  but tried to laugh it off <end>

 nay  how could i help saying what i did   nobody could have helped it <end>
it was not so very bad <end>  i dare say she did not understand me <end> 

 i assure you she did <end>  she felt your full meaning <end>  she has talked
of it since <end>  i wish you could have heard how she talked of it  
with what candour and generosity <end>  i wish you could have heard her
honouring your forbearance  in being able to pay her such attentions 
as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father 
when her society must be so irksome <end> 

 oh   cried emma   i know there is not a better creature in the world 
but you must allow  that what is good and what is ridiculous are
most unfortunately blended in her <end> 

 they are blended   said he   i acknowledge  and  were she prosperous 
i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous
over the good <end>  were she a woman of fortune  i would leave every
harmless absurdity to take its chance  i would not quarrel with you
for any liberties of manner <end>  were she your equal in situation  
but  emma  consider how far this is from being the case <end>  she is poor 
she has sunk from the comforts she was born to  and  if she live
to old age  must probably sink more <end>  her situation should secure
your compassion <end>  it was badly done  indeed   you  whom she had known
from an infant  whom she had seen grow up from a period when her
notice was an honour  to have you now  in thoughtless spirits 
and the pride of the moment  laugh at her  humble her  and before
her niece  too  and before others  many of whom  certainly  some   
would be entirely guided by  your  treatment of her <end>  this is not
pleasant to you  emma  and it is very far from pleasant to me 
but i must  i will   i will tell you truths while i can 
satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel 
and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice
than you can do now <end> 

while they talked  they were advancing towards the carriage 
it was ready  and  before she could speak again  he had handed her in <end>
he had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted 
and her tongue motionless <end>  they were combined only of anger
against herself  mortification  and deep concern <end>  she had not
been able to speak  and  on entering the carriage  sunk back
for a moment overcome  then reproaching herself for having taken
no leave  making no acknowledgment  parting in apparent sullenness 
she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference 
but it was just too late <end>  he had turned away  and the horses were
in motion <end>  she continued to look back  but in vain  and soon 
with what appeared unusual speed  they were half way down the hill 
and every thing left far behind <end>  she was vexed beyond what could
have been expressed  almost beyond what she could conceal <end>
never had she felt so agitated  mortified  grieved  at any circumstance
in her life <end>  she was most forcibly struck <end>  the truth of this
representation there was no denying <end>  she felt it at her heart <end>
how could she have been so brutal  so cruel to miss bates   how could
she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued 
and how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude 
of concurrence  of common kindness 

time did not compose her <end>  as she reflected more  she seemed
but to feel it more <end>  she never had been so depressed <end>  happily it
was not necessary to speak <end>  there was only harriet  who seemed not
in spirits herself  fagged  and very willing to be silent  and emma
felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home 
without being at any trouble to check them  extraordinary as they were <end>



chapter viii


the wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emma s thoughts all
the evening <end>  how it might be considered by the rest of the party 
she could not tell <end>  they  in their different homes  and their different
ways  might be looking back on it with pleasure  but in her view it
was a morning more completely misspent  more totally bare of rational
satisfaction at the time  and more to be abhorred in recollection 
than any she had ever passed <end>  a whole evening of back gammon with
her father  was felicity to it <end>   there   indeed  lay real pleasure 
for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty four
to his comfort  and feeling that  unmerited as might be the degree
of his fond affection and confiding esteem  she could not  in her
general conduct  be open to any severe reproach <end>  as a daughter 
she hoped she was not without a heart <end>  she hoped no one could
have said to her   how could you be so unfeeling to your father   
i must  i will tell you truths while i can <end>   miss bates should
never again  no  never   if attention  in future  could do away
the past  she might hope to be forgiven <end>  she had been often remiss 
her conscience told her so  remiss  perhaps  more in thought
than fact  scornful  ungracious <end>  but it should be so no more <end>
in the warmth of true contrition  she would call upon her the
very next morning  and it should be the beginning  on her side 
of a regular  equal  kindly intercourse <end>

she was just as determined when the morrow came  and went early 
that nothing might prevent her <end>  it was not unlikely  she thought 
that she might see mr <end> knightley in her way  or  perhaps  he might
come in while she were paying her visit <end>  she had no objection <end>
she would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence  so justly
and truly hers <end>  her eyes were towards donwell as she walked  but she
saw him not <end>

 the ladies were all at home <end>   she had never rejoiced at the sound
before  nor ever before entered the passage  nor walked up the stairs 
with any wish of giving pleasure  but in conferring obligation 
or of deriving it  except in subsequent ridicule <end>

there was a bustle on her approach  a good deal of moving and talking <end>
she heard miss bates s voice  something was to be done in a hurry 
the maid looked frightened and awkward  hoped she would be pleased
to wait a moment  and then ushered her in too soon <end>  the aunt and
niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room <end>  jane she had
a distinct glimpse of  looking extremely ill  and  before the door
had shut them out  she heard miss bates saying   well  my dear 
i shall  say  you are laid down upon the bed  and i am sure you are
ill enough <end> 

poor old mrs <end> bates  civil and humble as usual  looked as if she
did not quite understand what was going on <end>

 i am afraid jane is not very well   said she   but i do not know 
they  tell  me she is well <end>  i dare say my daughter will be here presently 
miss woodhouse <end>  i hope you find a chair <end>  i wish hetty had not gone <end>
i am very little able  have you a chair  ma am  do you sit where
you like   i am sure she will be here presently <end> 

emma seriously hoped she would <end>  she had a moment s fear of miss
bates keeping away from her <end>  but miss bates soon came   very happy
and obliged   but emma s conscience told her that there was not the
same cheerful volubility as before  less ease of look and manner <end>
a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax  she hoped  might lead
the way to a return of old feelings <end>  the touch seemed immediate <end>

 ah   miss woodhouse  how kind you are   i suppose you have heard  
and are come to give us joy <end>  this does not seem much like joy 
indeed  in me   twinkling away a tear or two   but it will be
very trying for us to part with her  after having had her so long 
and she has a dreadful headache just now  writing all the morning   
such long letters  you know  to be written to colonel campbell 
and mrs <end> dixon <end>   my dear   said i   you will blind yourself   
for tears were in her eyes perpetually <end>  one cannot wonder 
one cannot wonder <end>  it is a great change  and though she is
amazingly fortunate  such a situation  i suppose  as no young woman
before ever met with on first going out  do not think us ungrateful 
miss woodhouse  for such surprising good fortune   again dispersing
her tears   but  poor dear soul  if you were to see what a headache
she has <end>  when one is in great pain  you know one cannot feel
any blessing quite as it may deserve <end>  she is as low as possible <end>
to look at her  nobody would think how delighted and happy she
is to have secured such a situation <end>  you will excuse her not
coming to you  she is not able  she is gone into her own room  
i want her to lie down upon the bed <end>   my dear   said i   i shall
say you are laid down upon the bed    but  however  she is not 
she is walking about the room <end>  but  now that she has written
her letters  she says she shall soon be well <end>  she will be extremely
sorry to miss seeing you  miss woodhouse  but your kindness will
excuse her <end>  you were kept waiting at the door  i was quite ashamed  
but somehow there was a little bustle  for it so happened that we
had not heard the knock  and till you were on the stairs  we did
not know any body was coming <end>   it is only mrs <end> cole   said i 
 depend upon it <end>  nobody else would come so early <end>    well   said she 
 it must be borne some time or other  and it may as well be now <end> 
but then patty came in  and said it was you <end>   oh   said i 
 it is miss woodhouse   i am sure you will like to see her <end>   
 i can see nobody   said she  and up she got  and would go away 
and that was what made us keep you waiting  and extremely sorry
and ashamed we were <end>   if you must go  my dear   said i   you must 
and i will say you are laid down upon the bed <end>  

emma was most sincerely interested <end>  her heart had been long growing
kinder towards jane  and this picture of her present sufferings acted
as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion  and left her nothing
but pity  and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle
sensations of the past  obliged her to admit that jane might very
naturally resolve on seeing mrs <end> cole or any other steady friend 
when she might not bear to see herself <end>  she spoke as she felt 
with earnest regret and solicitude  sincerely wishing that the
circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually
determined on  might be as much for miss fairfax s advantage
and comfort as possible <end>   it must be a severe trial to them all <end>
she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbell s return <end> 

 so very kind   replied miss bates <end>   but you are always kind <end> 

there was no bearing such an  always   and to break through her
dreadful gratitude  emma made the direct inquiry of  

 where  may i ask   is miss fairfax going  

 to a mrs <end> smallridge  charming woman  most superior  to have
the charge of her three little girls  delightful children <end>
impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort 
if we except  perhaps  mrs <end> suckling s own family  and mrs <end> bragge s 
but mrs <end> smallridge is intimate with both  and in the very
same neighbourhood   lives only four miles from maple grove <end>
jane will be only four miles from maple grove <end> 

 mrs <end> elton  i suppose  has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes   

 yes  our good mrs <end> elton <end>  the most indefatigable  true friend <end>
she would not take a denial <end>  she would not let jane say   no   for
when jane first heard of it   it was the day before yesterday 
the very morning we were at donwell   when jane first heard of it 
she was quite decided against accepting the offer  and for the
reasons you mention  exactly as you say  she had made up her mind
to close with nothing till colonel campbell s return  and nothing
should induce her to enter into any engagement at present  and so she
told mrs <end> elton over and over again  and i am sure i had no more
idea that she would change her mind   but that good mrs <end> elton 
whose judgment never fails her  saw farther than i did <end>  it is not
every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did 
and refuse to take jane s answer  but she positively declared she
would  not  write any such denial yesterday  as jane wished her 
she would wait  and  sure enough  yesterday evening it was all
settled that jane should go <end>  quite a surprize to me   i had not
the least idea   jane took mrs <end> elton aside  and told her at once 
that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs <end> smallridge s situation 
she had come to the resolution of accepting it <end>  i did not know a word
of it till it was all settled <end> 

 you spent the evening with mrs <end> elton  

 yes  all of us  mrs <end> elton would have us come <end>  it was settled so 
upon the hill  while we were walking about with mr <end> knightley <end>
 you  must   all  spend your evening with us   said she   i positively must
have you  all  come <end>  

 mr <end> knightley was there too  was he  

 no  not mr <end> knightley  he declined it from the first  and though i
thought he would come  because mrs <end> elton declared she would not let
him off  he did not   but my mother  and jane  and i  were all there 
and a very agreeable evening we had <end>  such kind friends  you know 
miss woodhouse  one must always find agreeable  though every body
seemed rather fagged after the morning s party <end>  even pleasure 
you know  is fatiguing  and i cannot say that any of them seemed
very much to have enjoyed it <end>  however   i  shall always think it
a very pleasant party  and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends
who included me in it <end> 

 miss fairfax  i suppose  though you were not aware of it  had been
making up her mind the whole day  

 i dare say she had <end> 

 whenever the time may come  it must be unwelcome to her and all
her friends  but i hope her engagement will have every alleviation
that is possible  i mean  as to the character and manners of the family <end> 

 thank you  dear miss woodhouse <end>  yes  indeed  there is every thing
in the world that can make her happy in it <end>  except the sucklings
and bragges  there is not such another nursery establishment 
so liberal and elegant  in all mrs <end> elton s acquaintance <end>
mrs <end> smallridge  a most delightful woman   a style of living almost
equal to maple grove  and as to the children  except the little
sucklings and little bragges  there are not such elegant sweet
children anywhere <end>  jane will be treated with such regard and kindness   
it will be nothing but pleasure  a life of pleasure <end>  and her salary   
i really cannot venture to name her salary to you  miss woodhouse <end>
even you  used as you are to great sums  would hardly believe that
so much could be given to a young person like jane <end> 

 ah  madam   cried emma   if other children are at all like what i
remember to have been myself  i should think five times the amount
of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions 
dearly earned <end> 

 you are so noble in your ideas  

 and when is miss fairfax to leave you  

 very soon  very soon  indeed  that s the worst of it <end>
within a fortnight <end>  mrs <end> smallridge is in a great hurry <end>  my poor
mother does not know how to bear it <end>  so then  i try to put it out of
her thoughts  and say  come ma am  do not let us think about it any more <end> 

 her friends must all be sorry to lose her  and will not colonel
and mrs <end> campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself
before their return  

 yes  jane says she is sure they will  but yet  this is such
a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining <end>
i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying
to mrs <end> elton  and when mrs <end> elton at the same moment came congratulating
me upon it   it was before tea  stay  no  it could not be before tea 
because we were just going to cards  and yet it was before tea 
because i remember thinking  oh  no  now i recollect  now i have it 
something happened before tea  but not that <end>  mr <end> elton was called
out of the room before tea  old john abdy s son wanted to speak
with him <end>  poor old john  i have a great regard for him  he was clerk
to my poor father twenty seven years  and now  poor old man  he is
bed ridden  and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints  
i must go and see him to day  and so will jane  i am sure  if she
gets out at all <end>  and poor john s son came to talk to mr <end> elton
about relief from the parish  he is very well to do himself 
you know  being head man at the crown  ostler  and every thing
of that sort  but still he cannot keep his father without some help 
and so  when mr <end> elton came back  he told us what john ostler
had been telling him  and then it came out about the chaise having
been sent to randalls to take mr <end> frank churchill to richmond <end>
that was what happened before tea <end>  it was after tea that jane spoke
to mrs <end> elton <end> 

miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly
new this circumstance was to her  but as without supposing it
possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars
of mr <end> frank churchill s going  she proceeded to give them all 
it was of no consequence <end>

what mr <end> elton had learned from the ostler on the subject  being the
accumulation of the ostler s own knowledge  and the knowledge
of the servants at randalls  was  that a messenger had come over
from richmond soon after the return of the party from box hill  
which messenger  however  had been no more than was expected 
and that mr <end> churchill had sent his nephew a few lines  containing 
upon the whole  a tolerable account of mrs <end> churchill  and only
wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early 
but that mr <end> frank churchill having resolved to go home directly 
without waiting at all  and his horse seeming to have got a cold 
tom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise  and the
ostler had stood out and seen it pass by  the boy going a good pace 
and driving very steady <end>

there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest 
and it caught emma s attention only as it united with the subject
which already engaged her mind <end>  the contrast between mrs <end> churchill s
importance in the world  and jane fairfax s  struck her  one was
every thing  the other nothing  and she sat musing on the difference
of woman s destiny  and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed 
till roused by miss bates s saying 

 aye  i see what you are thinking of  the pianoforte <end>  what is to become
of that   very true <end>  poor dear jane was talking of it just now <end>  
 you must go   said she <end>   you and i must part <end>  you will have no
business here <end>  let it stay  however   said she   give it houseroom
till colonel campbell comes back <end>  i shall talk about it to him 
he will settle for me  he will help me out of all my difficulties <end>   
and to this day  i do believe  she knows not whether it was his
present or his daughter s <end> 

now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte  and the remembrance
of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing 
that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been
long enough  and  with a repetition of every thing that she could
venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt  took leave <end>



chapter ix


emma s pensive meditations  as she walked home  were not interrupted 
but on entering the parlour  she found those who must rouse her <end>
mr <end> knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence  and were
sitting with her father <end>  mr <end> knightley immediately got up  and in a
manner decidedly graver than usual  said 

 i would not go away without seeing you  but i have no time to spare 
and therefore must now be gone directly <end>  i am going to london 
to spend a few days with john and isabella <end>  have you any thing to
send or say  besides the  love   which nobody carries  

 nothing at all <end>  but is not this a sudden scheme  

 yes  rather  i have been thinking of it some little time <end> 

emma was sure he had not forgiven her  he looked unlike himself <end>
time  however  she thought  would tell him that they ought to be
friends again <end>  while he stood  as if meaning to go  but not going  
her father began his inquiries <end>

 well  my dear  and did you get there safely   and how did you
find my worthy old friend and her daughter   i dare say they must
have been very much obliged to you for coming <end>  dear emma has been
to call on mrs <end> and miss bates  mr <end> knightley  as i told you before <end>
she is always so attentive to them  

emma s colour was heightened by this unjust praise  and with a smile 
and shake of the head  which spoke much  she looked at mr <end> knightley <end>  
it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour 
as if his eyes received the truth from her s  and all that had
passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured <end>  
he looked at her with a glow of regard <end>  she was warmly gratified  
and in another moment still more so  by a little movement of
more than common friendliness on his part <end>  he took her hand   
whether she had not herself made the first motion  she could not say  
she might  perhaps  have rather offered it  but he took her hand 
pressed it  and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips  
when  from some fancy or other  he suddenly let it go <end>  why he should feel
such a scruple  why he should change his mind when it was all but done 
she could not perceive <end>  he would have judged better  she thought 
if he had not stopped <end>  the intention  however  was indubitable 
and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry 
or however else it happened  but she thought nothing became him more <end>  
it was with him  of so simple  yet so dignified a nature <end>  
she could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction <end>
it spoke such perfect amity <end>  he left them immediately afterwards  
gone in a moment <end>  he always moved with the alertness of a mind which
could neither be undecided nor dilatory  but now he seemed more sudden
than usual in his disappearance <end>

emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates  but she wished
she had left her ten minutes earlier   it would have been a great
pleasure to talk over jane fairfax s situation with mr <end> knightley <end>  
neither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square 
for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed  but it might have
happened at a better time  and to have had longer notice of it 
would have been pleasanter <end>  they parted thorough friends  however 
she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance 
and his unfinished gallantry   it was all done to assure her that she
had fully recovered his good opinion <end>  he had been sitting with them
half an hour  she found <end>  it was a pity that she had not come
back earlier 

in the hope of diverting her father s thoughts from the disagreeableness
of mr <end> knightley s going to london  and going so suddenly 
and going on horseback  which she knew would be all very bad 
emma communicated her news of jane fairfax  and her dependence
on the effect was justified  it supplied a very useful check   
interested  without disturbing him <end>  he had long made up his mind to jane
fairfax s going out as governess  and could talk of it cheerfully 
but mr <end> knightley s going to london had been an unexpected blow <end>

 i am very glad  indeed  my dear  to hear she is to be so
comfortably settled <end>  mrs <end> elton is very good natured and agreeable 
and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought
to be <end>  i hope it is a dry situation  and that her health
will be taken good care of <end>  it ought to be a first object 
as i am sure poor miss taylor s always was with me <end>  you know 
my dear  she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor
was to us <end>  and i hope she will be better off in one respect 
and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long <end> 

the following day brought news from richmond to throw every
thing else into the background <end>  an express arrived at randalls
to announce the death of mrs <end> churchill   though her nephew
had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account 
she had not lived above six and thirty hours after his return <end>
a sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded
by her general state  had carried her off after a short struggle <end>
the great mrs <end> churchill was no more <end>

it was felt as such things must be felt <end>  every body had a
degree of gravity and sorrow  tenderness towards the departed 
solicitude for the surviving friends  and  in a reasonable time 
curiosity to know where she would be buried <end>  goldsmith tells us 
that when lovely woman stoops to folly  she has nothing to do
but to die  and when she stoops to be disagreeable  it is equally
to be recommended as a clearer of ill fame <end> mrs <end> churchill 
after being disliked at least twenty five years  was now spoken of
with compassionate allowances <end>  in one point she was fully justified <end>
she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill <end>  the event
acquitted her of all the fancifulness  and all the selfishness
of imaginary complaints <end>

 poor mrs <end> churchill  no doubt she had been suffering a great deal 
more than any body had ever supposed  and continual pain would try
the temper <end>  it was a sad event  a great shock  with all her faults 
what would mr <end> churchill do without her   mr <end> churchill s loss
would be dreadful indeed <end>  mr <end> churchill would never get over it <end>   
even mr <end> weston shook his head  and looked solemn  and said 
 ah  poor woman  who would have thought it   and resolved  that his
mourning should be as handsome as possible  and his wife sat sighing
and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense 
true and steady <end>  how it would affect frank was among the earliest
thoughts of both <end>  it was also a very early speculation with emma <end>
the character of mrs <end> churchill  the grief of her husband  her mind
glanced over them both with awe and compassion  and then rested
with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event 
how benefited  how freed <end>  she saw in a moment all the possible good <end>
now  an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter <end>
mr <end> churchill  independent of his wife  was feared by nobody 
an easy  guidable man  to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew <end>
all that remained to be wished was  that the nephew should form
the attachment  as  with all her goodwill in the cause  emma could feel
no certainty of its being already formed <end>

harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion  with great self command <end>
what ever she might feel of brighter hope  she betrayed nothing <end>  emma was
gratified  to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character 
and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance <end>
they spoke  therefore  of mrs <end> churchill s death with mutual forbearance <end>

short letters from frank were received at randalls  communicating
all that was immediately important of their state and plans <end>
mr <end> churchill was better than could be expected  and their
first removal  on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire 
was to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor  to whom
mr <end> churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years <end>
at present  there was nothing to be done for harriet  good wishes
for the future were all that could yet be possible on emma s side <end>

it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax 
whose prospects were closing  while harriet s opened  and whose
engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury  who wished
to shew her kindness  and with emma it was grown into a first wish <end>
she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness 
and the person  whom she had been so many months neglecting  was now
the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of
regard or sympathy <end>  she wanted to be of use to her  wanted to shew
a value for her society  and testify respect and consideration <end>
she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield <end>
a note was written to urge it <end>  the invitation was refused  and by
a verbal message <end>   miss fairfax was not well enough to write  
and when mr <end> perry called at hartfield  the same morning 
it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited 
though against her own consent  by himself  and that she was suffering
under severe headaches  and a nervous fever to a degree  which made
him doubt the possibility of her going to mrs <end> smallridge s at the
time proposed <end>  her health seemed for the moment completely deranged  
appetite quite gone  and though there were no absolutely
alarming symptoms  nothing touching the pulmonary complaint 
which was the standing apprehension of the family  mr <end> perry was
uneasy about her <end>  he thought she had undertaken more than she
was equal to  and that she felt it so herself  though she would
not own it <end>  her spirits seemed overcome <end>  her present home 
he could not but observe  was unfavourable to a nervous disorder   
confined always to one room   he could have wished it otherwise  
and her good aunt  though his very old friend  he must acknowledge
to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description <end>
her care and attention could not be questioned  they were  in fact 
only too great <end>  he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more
evil than good from them <end>  emma listened with the warmest concern 
grieved for her more and more  and looked around eager to discover
some way of being useful <end>  to take her  be it only an hour
or two  from her aunt  to give her change of air and scene 
and quiet rational conversation  even for an hour or two 
might do her good  and the following morning she wrote again to say 
in the most feeling language she could command  that she would
call for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would name  
mentioning that she had mr <end> perry s decided opinion  in favour
of such exercise for his patient <end>  the answer was only in this
short note 

 miss fairfax s compliments and thanks  but is quite unequal
to any exercise <end> 

emma felt that her own note had deserved something better  but it
was impossible to quarrel with words  whose tremulous inequality
shewed indisposition so plainly  and she thought only of how she
might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted <end>
in spite of the answer  therefore  she ordered the carriage  and drove
to mrs <end> bates s  in the hope that jane would be induced to join her  
but it would not do   miss bates came to the carriage door  all gratitude 
and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of
the greatest service  and every thing that message could do was tried  
but all in vain <end>  miss bates was obliged to return without success 
jane was quite unpersuadable  the mere proposal of going out
seemed to make her worse <end>  emma wished she could have seen her 
and tried her own powers  but  almost before she could hint the wish 
miss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on
no account to let miss woodhouse in <end>   indeed  the truth was 
that poor dear jane could not bear to see any body  any body at all  
mrs <end> elton  indeed  could not be denied  and mrs <end> cole had made
such a point  and mrs <end> perry had said so much  but  except them 
jane would really see nobody <end> 

emma did not want to be classed with the mrs <end> eltons  the mrs <end> perrys 
and the mrs <end> coles  who would force themselves anywhere 
neither could she feel any right of preference herself  
she submitted  therefore  and only questioned miss bates farther
as to her niece s appetite and diet  which she longed to be able
to assist <end>  on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy 
and very communicative  jane would hardly eat any thing   
mr <end> perry recommended nourishing food  but every thing they could
command  and never had any body such good neighbours  was distasteful <end>

emma  on reaching home  called the housekeeper directly  to an
examination of her stores  and some arrowroot of very superior quality
was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note <end>
in half an hour the arrowroot was returned  with a thousand thanks
from miss bates  but  dear jane would not be satisfied without its
being sent back  it was a thing she could not take  and  moreover 
she insisted on her saying  that she was not at all in want of any thing <end> 

when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering
about the meadows  at some distance from highbury  on the afternoon
of the very day on which she had  under the plea of being unequal
to any exercise  so peremptorily refused to go out with her in
the carriage  she could have no doubt  putting every thing together  
that jane was resolved to receive no kindness from  her  <end>  she was sorry 
very sorry <end>  her heart was grieved for a state which seemed
but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits 
inconsistency of action  and inequality of powers  and it mortified
her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling  or esteemed
so little worthy as a friend   but she had the consolation of knowing
that her intentions were good  and of being able to say to herself 
that could mr <end> knightley have been privy to all her attempts
of assisting jane fairfax  could he even have seen into her heart 
he would not  on this occasion  have found any thing to reprove <end>



chapter x


one morning  about ten days after mrs <end> churchill s decease 
emma was called downstairs to mr <end> weston  who  could not stay
five minutes  and wanted particularly to speak with her <end>   
he met her at the parlour door  and hardly asking her how she did 
in the natural key of his voice  sunk it immediately  to say 
unheard by her father 

 can you come to randalls at any time this morning   do  if it
be possible <end>  mrs <end> weston wants to see you <end>  she must see you <end> 

 is she unwell  

 no  no  not at all  only a little agitated <end>  she would have
ordered the carriage  and come to you  but she must see you  alone  
and that you know   nodding towards her father   humph   can you come  

 certainly <end>  this moment  if you please <end>  it is impossible to
refuse what you ask in such a way <end>  but what can be the matter   
is she really not ill  

 depend upon me  but ask no more questions <end>  you will know it
all in time <end>  the most unaccountable business   but hush  hush  

to guess what all this meant  was impossible even for emma <end>
something really important seemed announced by his looks 
but  as her friend was well  she endeavoured not to be uneasy 
and settling it with her father  that she would take her walk now 
she and mr <end> weston were soon out of the house together and on
their way at a quick pace for randalls <end>

 now    said emma  when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates   
 now mr <end> weston  do let me know what has happened <end> 

 no  no    he gravely replied <end>   don t ask me <end>  i promised my wife
to leave it all to her <end>  she will break it to you better than i can <end>
do not be impatient  emma  it will all come out too soon <end> 

 break it to me   cried emma  standing still with terror <end>  
 good god   mr <end> weston  tell me at once <end>  something has happened
in brunswick square <end>  i know it has <end>  tell me  i charge you tell
me this moment what it is <end> 

 no  indeed you are mistaken <end>   

 mr <end> weston do not trifle with me <end>  consider how many of my dearest
friends are now in brunswick square <end>  which of them is it   
i charge you by all that is sacred  not to attempt concealment <end> 

 upon my word  emma <end>   

 your word   why not your honour   why not say upon your honour 
that it has nothing to do with any of them   good heavens   what can
be to be  broke  to me  that does not relate to one of that family  

 upon my honour   said he very seriously   it does not <end>  it is not
in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name
of knightley <end> 

emma s courage returned  and she walked on <end>

 i was wrong   he continued   in talking of its being  broke  to you <end>
i should not have used the expression <end>  in fact  it does not concern you  
it concerns only myself   that is  we hope <end>  humph   in short 
my dear emma  there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it <end>
i don t say that it is not a disagreeable business  but things might
be much worse <end>  if we walk fast  we shall soon be at randalls <end> 

emma found that she must wait  and now it required little effort <end>
she asked no more questions therefore  merely employed her own fancy 
and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some
money concern  something just come to light  of a disagreeable
nature in the circumstances of the family   something which the late
event at richmond had brought forward <end>  her fancy was very active <end>
half a dozen natural children  perhaps  and poor frank cut off   
this  though very undesirable  would be no matter of agony to her <end>
it inspired little more than an animating curiosity <end>

 who is that gentleman on horseback   said she  as they proceeded  
speaking more to assist mr <end> weston in keeping his secret  than with
any other view <end>

 i do not know <end>  one of the otways <end>  not frank   it is not frank 
i assure you <end>  you will not see him <end>  he is half way to windsor
by this time <end> 

 has your son been with you  then  

 oh  yes  did not you know   well  well  never mind <end> 

for a moment he was silent  and then added  in a tone much more
guarded and demure 

 yes  frank came over this morning  just to ask us how we did <end> 

they hurried on  and were speedily at randalls <end>   well  my dear  
said he  as they entered the room   i have brought her  and now
i hope you will soon be better <end>  i shall leave you together <end>
there is no use in delay <end>  i shall not be far off  if you want me <end>   
and emma distinctly heard him add  in a lower tone  before he
quitted the room    i have been as good as my word <end>  she has not the
least idea <end> 

mrs <end> weston was looking so ill  and had an air of so much perturbation 
that emma s uneasiness increased  and the moment they were alone 
she eagerly said 

 what is it my dear friend   something of a very unpleasant nature 
i find  has occurred   do let me know directly what it is <end>
i have been walking all this way in complete suspense <end>  we both
abhor suspense <end>  do not let mine continue longer <end>  it will do you
good to speak of your distress  whatever it may be <end> 

 have you indeed no idea   said mrs <end> weston in a trembling voice <end>
 cannot you  my dear emma  cannot you form a guess as to what you
are to hear  

 so far as that it relates to mr <end> frank churchill  i do guess <end> 

 you are right <end>  it does relate to him  and i will tell you directly  
 resuming her work  and seeming resolved against looking up <end> 
 he has been here this very morning  on a most extraordinary errand <end>
it is impossible to express our surprize <end>  he came to speak to his
father on a subject   to announce an attachment   

she stopped to breathe <end>  emma thought first of herself  and then
of harriet <end>

 more than an attachment  indeed   resumed mrs <end> weston   an engagement  
a positive engagement <end>  what will you say  emma  what will any
body say  when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax
are engaged   nay  that they have been long engaged  

emma even jumped with surprize   and  horror struck  exclaimed 

 jane fairfax   good god   you are not serious   you do not mean it  

 you may well be amazed   returned mrs <end> weston  still averting her eyes 
and talking on with eagerness  that emma might have time to recover  
 you may well be amazed <end>  but it is even so <end>  there has been a solemn
engagement between them ever since october  formed at weymouth 
and kept a secret from every body <end>  not a creature knowing it
but themselves  neither the campbells  nor her family  nor his <end>  
it is so wonderful  that though perfectly convinced of the fact 
it is yet almost incredible to myself <end>  i can hardly believe it <end>  
i thought i knew him <end> 

emma scarcely heard what was said <end>  her mind was divided between
two ideas  her own former conversations with him about miss fairfax 
and poor harriet   and for some time she could only exclaim 
and require confirmation  repeated confirmation <end>

 well   said she at last  trying to recover herself   this is a
circumstance which i must think of at least half a day  before i
can at all comprehend it <end>  what   engaged to her all the winter  
before either of them came to highbury  

 engaged since october   secretly engaged <end>  it has hurt me 
emma  very much <end>  it has hurt his father equally <end>   some   part 
of his conduct we cannot excuse <end> 

emma pondered a moment  and then replied   i will not pretend
 not  to understand you  and to give you all the relief in my power 
be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me 
as you are apprehensive of <end> 

mrs <end> weston looked up  afraid to believe  but emma s countenance
was as steady as her words <end>

 that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast  of my
present perfect indifference   she continued   i will farther tell you 
that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance 
when i did like him  when i was very much disposed to be
attached to him  nay  was attached  and how it came to cease 
is perhaps the wonder <end>  fortunately  however  it did cease <end>
i have really for some time past  for at least these three months 
cared nothing about him <end>  you may believe me  mrs <end> weston <end>
this is the simple truth <end> 

mrs <end> weston kissed her with tears of joy  and when she could
find utterance  assured her  that this protestation had done
her more good than any thing else in the world could do <end>

 mr <end> weston will be almost as much relieved as myself   said she <end>
 on this point we have been wretched <end>  it was our darling wish that you
might be attached to each other  and we were persuaded that it was so <end>  
imagine what we have been feeling on your account <end> 

 i have escaped  and that i should escape  may be a matter of
grateful wonder to you and myself <end>  but this does not acquit  him  
mrs <end> weston  and i must say  that i think him greatly to blame <end>
what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged 
and with manners so  very  disengaged   what right had he to endeavour
to please  as he certainly did  to distinguish any one young woman with
persevering attention  as he certainly did  while he really belonged
to another   how could he tell what mischief he might be doing   
how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him   
very wrong  very wrong indeed <end> 

 from something that he said  my dear emma  i rather imagine   

 and how could  she  bear such behaviour   composure with a witness 
to look on  while repeated attentions were offering to another woman 
before her face  and not resent it <end>  that is a degree of placidity 
which i can neither comprehend nor respect <end> 

 there were misunderstandings between them  emma  he said
so expressly <end>  he had not time to enter into much explanation <end>
he was here only a quarter of an hour  and in a state of agitation
which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay  
but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said <end>
the present crisis  indeed  seemed to be brought on by them 
and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the
impropriety of his conduct <end> 

 impropriety   oh   mrs <end> weston  it is too calm a censure <end>
much  much beyond impropriety   it has sunk him  i cannot say how
it has sunk him in my opinion <end>  so unlike what a man should be   
none of that upright integrity  that strict adherence to truth
and principle  that disdain of trick and littleness  which a man
should display in every transaction of his life <end> 

 nay  dear emma  now i must take his part  for though he has been
wrong in this instance  i have known him long enough to answer
for his having many  very many  good qualities  and   

 good god   cried emma  not attending to her <end>   mrs <end> smallridge  too 
jane actually on the point of going as governess   what could he
mean by such horrible indelicacy   to suffer her to engage herself  
to suffer her even to think of such a measure  

 he knew nothing about it  emma <end>  on this article i can fully
acquit him <end>  it was a private resolution of hers  not communicated
to him  or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction <end>  
till yesterday  i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans <end>
they burst on him  i do not know how  but by some letter or message  
and it was the discovery of what she was doing  of this very project
of hers  which determined him to come forward at once  own it
all to his uncle  throw himself on his kindness  and  in short 
put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been
carrying on so long <end> 

emma began to listen better <end>

 i am to hear from him soon   continued mrs <end> weston <end>   he told me
at parting  that he should soon write  and he spoke in a manner which
seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now <end>
let us wait  therefore  for this letter <end>  it may bring many extenuations <end>
it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are
not to be understood <end>  don t let us be severe  don t let us be in
a hurry to condemn him <end>  let us have patience <end>  i must love him 
and now that i am satisfied on one point  the one material point 
i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well  and ready
to hope that it may <end>  they must both have suffered a great deal
under such a system of secresy and concealment <end> 

  his  sufferings   replied emma dryly   do not appear to have done
him much harm <end>  well  and how did mr <end> churchill take it  

 most favourably for his nephew  gave his consent with scarcely
a difficulty <end>  conceive what the events of a week have done
in that family   while poor mrs <end> churchill lived  i suppose there
could not have been a hope  a chance  a possibility   but scarcely
are her remains at rest in the family vault  than her husband is
persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required <end>
what a blessing it is  when undue influence does not survive the grave   
he gave his consent with very little persuasion <end> 

 ah   thought emma   he would have done as much for harriet <end> 

 this was settled last night  and frank was off with the light
this morning <end>  he stopped at highbury  at the bates s  i fancy 
some time  and then came on hither  but was in such a hurry to get
back to his uncle  to whom he is just now more necessary than ever 
that  as i tell you  he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour <end>  
he was very much agitated  very much  indeed  to a degree that made
him appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen
him before <end>  in addition to all the rest  there had been the shock of
finding her so very unwell  which he had had no previous suspicion of  
and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal <end> 

 and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on
with such perfect secresy   the campbells  the dixons  did none
of them know of the engagement  

emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush <end>

 none  not one <end>  he positively said that it had been known to no
being in the world but their two selves <end> 

 well   said emma   i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled
to the idea  and i wish them very happy <end>  but i shall always
think it a very abominable sort of proceeding <end>  what has it been
but a system of hypocrisy and deceit   espionage  and treachery   
to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity 
and such a league in secret to judge us all   here have we been 
the whole winter and spring  completely duped  fancying ourselves
all on an equal footing of truth and honour  with two people in the
midst of us who may have been carrying round  comparing and sitting
in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both
to hear <end>  they must take the consequence  if they have heard each
other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable  

 i am quite easy on that head   replied mrs <end> weston <end>   i am
very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other 
which both might not have heard <end> 

 you are in luck <end>  your only blunder was confined to my ear 
when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady <end> 

 true <end>  but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss
fairfax  i never could  under any blunder  have spoken ill of her 
and as to speaking ill of him  there i must have been safe <end> 

at this moment mr <end> weston appeared at a little distance from the window 
evidently on the watch <end>  his wife gave him a look which invited
him in  and  while he was coming round  added   now  dearest emma 
let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his
heart at ease  and incline him to be satisfied with the match <end>
let us make the best of it  and  indeed  almost every thing may
be fairly said in her favour <end>  it is not a connexion to gratify 
but if mr <end> churchill does not feel that  why should we  and it
may be a very fortunate circumstance for him  for frank  i mean 
that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness
of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for  
and still am disposed to give her credit for  in spite of this
one great deviation from the strict rule of right <end>  and how much
may be said in her situation for even that error  

 much  indeed   cried emma feelingly <end>   if a woman can ever
be excused for thinking only of herself  it is in a situation
like jane fairfax s <end>  of such  one may almost say  that  the
world is not their s  nor the world s law <end>  

she met mr <end> weston on his entrance  with a smiling countenance 
exclaiming 

 a very pretty trick you have been playing me  upon my word 
this was a device  i suppose  to sport with my curiosity 
and exercise my talent of guessing <end>  but you really frightened me <end>
i thought you had lost half your property  at least <end>  and here 
instead of its being a matter of condolence  it turns out to be one
of congratulation <end>  i congratulate you  mr <end> weston  with all my heart 
on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished
young women in england for your daughter <end> 

a glance or two between him and his wife  convinced him that all was
as right as this speech proclaimed  and its happy effect on his spirits
was immediate <end>  his air and voice recovered their usual briskness 
he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand  and entered
on the subject in a manner to prove  that he now only wanted
time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing <end>
his companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence 
or smooth objections  and by the time they had talked it all
over together  and he had talked it all over again with emma 
in their walk back to hartfield  he was become perfectly reconciled 
and not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could
possibly have done <end>



chapter xi


 harriet  poor harriet    those were the words  in them lay the
tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of  and which constituted
the real misery of the business to her <end>  frank churchill had behaved
very ill by herself  very ill in many ways   but it was not so much
 his  behaviour as her  own   which made her so angry with him <end>
it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriet s account 
that gave the deepest hue to his offence <end>  poor harriet  to be a second
time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery <end>  mr <end> knightley
had spoken prophetically  when he once said   emma  you have been
no friend to harriet smith <end>   she was afraid she had done her nothing
but disservice <end>  it was true that she had not to charge herself 
in this instance as in the former  with being the sole and original
author of the mischief  with having suggested such feelings as might
otherwise never have entered harriet s imagination  for harriet
had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill
before she had ever given her a hint on the subject  but she felt
completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed <end>
she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments <end>
her influence would have been enough <end>  and now she was very conscious
that she ought to have prevented them <end>  she felt that she had been
risking her friend s happiness on most insufficient grounds <end>
common sense would have directed her to tell harriet  that she
must not allow herself to think of him  and that there were five
hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her <end>   but  with
common sense   she added   i am afraid i have had little to do <end> 

she was extremely angry with herself <end>  if she could not have been
angry with frank churchill too  it would have been dreadful <end>  
as for jane fairfax  she might at least relieve her feelings
from any present solicitude on her account <end>  harriet would
be anxiety enough  she need no longer be unhappy about jane 
whose troubles and whose ill health having  of course  the same origin 
must be equally under cure <end>  her days of insignificance and evil
were over <end>  she would soon be well  and happy  and prosperous <end>  
emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted <end>
this discovery laid many smaller matters open <end>  no doubt it had been
from jealousy <end>  in jane s eyes she had been a rival  and well might
any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed <end>
an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack 
and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison <end>
she understood it all  and as far as her mind could disengage itself
from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings  she acknowledged
that jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond
her desert <end>  but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge 
there was little sympathy to be spared for any body else <end>
emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be
more severe than the first <end>  considering the very superior claims
of the object  it ought  and judging by its apparently stronger effect
on harriet s mind  producing reserve and self command  it would <end>  
she must communicate the painful truth  however  and as soon
as possible <end>  an injunction of secresy had been among mr <end> weston s
parting words <end>   for the present  the whole affair was to be
completely a secret <end>  mr <end> churchill had made a point of it 
as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost 
and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum <end>   
emma had promised  but still harriet must be excepted <end>  it was her
superior duty <end>

in spite of her vexation  she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous 
that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to
perform by harriet  which mrs <end> weston had just gone through by herself <end>
the intelligence  which had been so anxiously announced to her 
she was now to be anxiously announcing to another <end>  her heart beat
quick on hearing harriet s footstep and voice  so  she supposed 
had poor mrs <end> weston felt when  she  was approaching randalls <end>
could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance   
but of that  unfortunately  there could be no chance <end>

 well  miss woodhouse   cried harriet  coming eagerly into the room  
 is not this the oddest news that ever was  

 what news do you mean   replied emma  unable to guess  by look
or voice  whether harriet could indeed have received any hint <end>

 about jane fairfax <end>  did you ever hear any thing so strange 
oh   you need not be afraid of owning it to me  for mr <end> weston has
told me himself <end>  i met him just now <end>  he told me it was to be
a great secret  and  therefore  i should not think of mentioning
it to any body but you  but he said you knew it <end> 

 what did mr <end> weston tell you    said emma  still perplexed <end>

 oh  he told me all about it  that jane fairfax and mr <end> frank
churchill are to be married  and that they have been privately
engaged to one another this long while <end>  how very odd  

it was  indeed  so odd  harriet s behaviour was so extremely odd 
that emma did not know how to understand it <end>  her character appeared
absolutely changed <end>  she seemed to propose shewing no agitation 
or disappointment  or peculiar concern in the discovery <end>  emma looked
at her  quite unable to speak <end>

 had you any idea   cried harriet   of his being in love
with her   you  perhaps  might <end>  you  blushing as she spoke 
who can see into every body s heart  but nobody else   

 upon my word   said emma   i begin to doubt my having any such talent <end>
can you seriously ask me  harriet  whether i imagined him attached
to another woman at the very time that i was  tacitly  if not openly  
encouraging you to give way to your own feelings   i never had
the slightest suspicion  till within the last hour  of mr <end> frank
churchill s having the least regard for jane fairfax <end>  you may be
very sure that if i had  i should have cautioned you accordingly <end> 

 me   cried harriet  colouring  and astonished <end>   why should you
caution me   you do not think i care about mr <end> frank churchill <end> 

 i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject  
replied emma  smiling   but you do not mean to deny that there
was a time  and not very distant either  when you gave me reason
to understand that you did care about him  

 him   never  never <end>  dear miss woodhouse  how could you so mistake me  
turning away distressed <end>

 harriet   cried emma  after a moment s pause   what do you mean   
good heaven  what do you mean   mistake you   am i to suppose then    

she could not speak another word <end>  her voice was lost  and she
sat down  waiting in great terror till harriet should answer <end>

harriet  who was standing at some distance  and with face turned
from her  did not immediately say any thing  and when she did speak 
it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emma s <end>

 i should not have thought it possible   she began   that you
could have misunderstood me   i know we agreed never to name him  
but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else 
i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed
to mean any other person <end>  mr <end> frank churchill  indeed   i do not
know who would ever look at him in the company of the other <end>
i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr <end> frank churchill 
who is like nobody by his side <end>  and that you should have been
so mistaken  is amazing   i am sure  but for believing that you
entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment 
i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost 
to dare to think of him <end>  at first  if you had not told me
that more wonderful things had happened  that there had been
matches of greater disparity  those were your very words    
i should not have dared to give way to  i should not have thought
it possible  but if  you   who had been always acquainted with him   

 harriet   cried emma  collecting herself resolutely   let us
understand each other now  without the possibility of farther mistake <end>
are you speaking of  mr <end> knightley  

 to be sure i am <end>  i never could have an idea of any body else  
and so i thought you knew <end>  when we talked about him  it was as clear
as possible <end> 

 not quite   returned emma  with forced calmness   for all that
you then said  appeared to me to relate to a different person <end>
i could almost assert that you had  named  mr <end> frank churchill <end>
i am sure the service mr <end> frank churchill had rendered you 
in protecting you from the gipsies  was spoken of <end> 

 oh   miss woodhouse  how you do forget  

 my dear harriet  i perfectly remember the substance of what i
said on the occasion <end>  i told you that i did not wonder at
your attachment  that considering the service he had rendered you 
it was extremely natural   and you agreed to it  expressing yourself
very warmly as to your sense of that service  and mentioning
even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward
to your rescue <end>  the impression of it is strong on my memory <end> 

 oh  dear   cried harriet   now i recollect what you mean  but i
was thinking of something very different at the time <end>  it was not
the gipsies  it was not mr <end> frank churchill that i meant <end>  no   with
some elevation  i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance  
of mr <end> knightley s coming and asking me to dance  when mr <end> elton
would not stand up with me  and when there was no other partner in
the room <end>  that was the kind action  that was the noble benevolence
and generosity  that was the service which made me begin to feel
how superior he was to every other being upon earth <end> 

 good god   cried emma   this has been a most unfortunate  
most deplorable mistake   what is to be done  

 you would not have encouraged me  then  if you had understood me 
at least  however  i cannot be worse off than i should have been 
if the other had been the person  and now  it  is  possible   

she paused a few moments <end>  emma could not speak <end>

 i do not wonder  miss woodhouse   she resumed   that you should feel
a great difference between the two  as to me or as to any body <end>
you must think one five hundred million times more above me than
the other <end>  but i hope  miss woodhouse  that supposing  that if  
strange as it may appear   <end>  but you know they were your own words 
that  more  wonderful things had happened  matches of  greater  disparity
had taken place than between mr <end> frank churchill and me  and  therefore 
it seems as if such a thing even as this  may have occurred before  
and if i should be so fortunate  beyond expression  as to  
if mr <end> knightley should really  if  he  does not mind the disparity 
i hope  dear miss woodhouse  you will not set yourself against it 
and try to put difficulties in the way <end>  but you are too good for that 
i am sure <end> 

harriet was standing at one of the windows <end>  emma turned round
to look at her in consternation  and hastily said 

 have you any idea of mr <end> knightley s returning your affection  

 yes   replied harriet modestly  but not fearfully   i must say
that i have <end> 

emma s eyes were instantly withdrawn  and she sat silently meditating 
in a fixed attitude  for a few minutes <end>  a few minutes were sufficient
for making her acquainted with her own heart <end>  a mind like hers 
once opening to suspicion  made rapid progress <end>  she touched  
she admitted  she acknowledged the whole truth <end>  why was it
so much worse that harriet should be in love with mr <end> knightley 
than with frank churchill   why was the evil so dreadfully increased
by harriet s having some hope of a return   it darted through her 
with the speed of an arrow  that mr <end> knightley must marry no one
but herself 

her own conduct  as well as her own heart  was before her in the
same few minutes <end>  she saw it all with a clearness which had
never blessed her before <end>  how improperly had she been acting
by harriet   how inconsiderate  how indelicate  how irrational 
how unfeeling had been her conduct   what blindness  what madness 
had led her on   it struck her with dreadful force  and she
was ready to give it every bad name in the world <end>  some portion
of respect for herself  however  in spite of all these demerits  
some concern for her own appearance  and a strong sense of justice
by harriet   there would be no need of  compassion  to the girl
who believed herself loved by mr <end> knightley  but justice required
that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now  
gave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness 
with even apparent kindness <end>  for her own advantage indeed  it was fit
that the utmost extent of harriet s hopes should be enquired into 
and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest
which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained  or to deserve
to be slighted by the person  whose counsels had never led her right <end>  
rousing from reflection  therefore  and subduing her emotion 
she turned to harriet again  and  in a more inviting accent  renewed
the conversation  for as to the subject which had first introduced it 
the wonderful story of jane fairfax  that was quite sunk and lost <end>  
neither of them thought but of mr <end> knightley and themselves <end>

harriet  who had been standing in no unhappy reverie  was yet very glad
to be called from it  by the now encouraging manner of such a judge 
and such a friend as miss woodhouse  and only wanted invitation 
to give the history of her hopes with great  though trembling
delight <end>  emma s tremblings as she asked  and as she listened 
were better concealed than harriet s  but they were not less <end>
her voice was not unsteady  but her mind was in all the perturbation
that such a development of self  such a burst of threatening evil 
such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions  must create <end>  
she listened with much inward suffering  but with great outward
patience  to harriet s detail <end>  methodical  or well arranged 
or very well delivered  it could not be expected to be 
but it contained  when separated from all the feebleness and
tautology of the narration  a substance to sink her spirit  
especially with the corroborating circumstances  which her own memory
brought in favour of mr <end> knightley s most improved opinion of harriet <end>

harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since
those two decisive dances <end>  emma knew that he had  on that occasion 
found her much superior to his expectation <end>  from that evening 
or at least from the time of miss woodhouse s encouraging her
to think of him  harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking
to her much more than he had been used to do  and of his having
indeed quite a different manner towards her  a manner of kindness
and sweetness   latterly she had been more and more aware of it <end>
when they had been all walking together  he had so often come and walked
by her  and talked so very delightfully   he seemed to want to be
acquainted with her <end>  emma knew it to have been very much the case <end>
she had often observed the change  to almost the same extent <end>  
harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him  
and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had
known of his opinion of harriet <end>  he praised her for being without
art or affectation  for having simple  honest  generous  feelings <end>  
she knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet  he had dwelt
on them to her more than once <end>  much that lived in harriet s memory 
many little particulars of the notice she had received from him  a look 
a speech  a removal from one chair to another  a compliment implied 
a preference inferred  had been unnoticed  because unsuspected 
by emma <end>  circumstances that might swell to half an hour s relation 
and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them  had passed
undiscerned by her who now heard them  but the two latest occurrences
to be mentioned  the two of strongest promise to harriet  were not
without some degree of witness from emma herself <end>  the first 
was his walking with her apart from the others  in the lime walk
at donwell  where they had been walking some time before emma came 
and he had taken pains  as she was convinced  to draw her from
the rest to himself  and at first  he had talked to her in a more
particular way than he had ever done before  in a very particular
way indeed    harriet could not recall it without a blush <end>  he seemed
to be almost asking her  whether her affections were engaged <end>  
but as soon as she  miss woodhouse  appeared likely to join them 
he changed the subject  and began talking about farming   
the second  was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour
before emma came back from her visit  the very last morning of his
being at hartfield  though  when he first came in  he had said
that he could not stay five minutes  and his having told her 
during their conversation  that though he must go to london 
it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all 
which was much more  as emma felt  than he had acknowledged to  her  <end>
the superior degree of confidence towards harriet  which this one
article marked  gave her severe pain <end>

on the subject of the first of the two circumstances  she did 
after a little reflection  venture the following question <end>
 might he not   is not it possible  that when enquiring  as you thought 
into the state of your affections  he might be alluding to mr <end> martin  
he might have mr <end> martin s interest in view   but harriet rejected
the suspicion with spirit <end>

 mr <end> martin   no indeed   there was not a hint of mr <end> martin <end>
i hope i know better now  than to care for mr <end> martin  or to be
suspected of it <end> 

when harriet had closed her evidence  she appealed to her dear
miss woodhouse  to say whether she had not good ground for hope <end>

 i never should have presumed to think of it at first   said she 
 but for you <end>  you told me to observe him carefully  and let
his behaviour be the rule of mine  and so i have <end>  but now i seem
to feel that i may deserve him  and that if he does chuse me 
it will not be any thing so very wonderful <end> 

the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech  the many bitter
feelings  made the utmost exertion necessary on emma s side 
to enable her to say on reply 

 harriet  i will only venture to declare  that mr <end> knightley is
the last man in the world  who would intentionally give any woman
the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does <end> 

harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory 
and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness  which at
that moment would have been dreadful penance  by the sound of her
father s footsteps <end>  he was coming through the hall <end>  harriet was
too much agitated to encounter him <end>   she could not compose herself  
mr <end> woodhouse would be alarmed  she had better go    with most ready
encouragement from her friend  therefore  she passed off through
another door  and the moment she was gone  this was the spontaneous
burst of emma s feelings    oh god  that i had never seen her  

the rest of the day  the following night  were hardly enough
for her thoughts <end>  she was bewildered amidst the confusion
of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours <end>
every moment had brought a fresh surprize  and every surprize
must be matter of humiliation to her <end>  how to understand it all 
how to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising
on herself  and living under   the blunders  the blindness of her
own head and heart   she sat still  she walked about  she tried her
own room  she tried the shrubbery  in every place  every posture 
she perceived that she had acted most weakly  that she had been imposed
on by others in a most mortifying degree  that she had been imposing
on herself in a degree yet more mortifying  that she was wretched 
and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness <end>

to understand  thoroughly understand her own heart  was the
first endeavour <end>  to that point went every leisure moment which her
father s claims on her allowed  and every moment of involuntary
absence of mind <end>

how long had mr <end> knightley been so dear to her  as every feeling
declared him now to be   when had his influence  such influence begun   
when had he succeeded to that place in her affection  which frank
churchill had once  for a short period  occupied   she looked back 
she compared the two  compared them  as they had always stood in
her estimation  from the time of the latter s becoming known to her  
and as they must at any time have been compared by her  had it  
oh  had it  by any blessed felicity  occurred to her  to institute
the comparison <end>  she saw that there never had been a time when she
did not consider mr <end> knightley as infinitely the superior  or when
his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear <end>  she saw 
that in persuading herself  in fancying  in acting to the contrary 
she had been entirely under a delusion  totally ignorant of her
own heart  and  in short  that she had never really cared for frank
churchill at all 

this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection <end>
this was the knowledge of herself  on the first question of inquiry 
which she reached  and without being long in reaching it <end>  
she was most sorrowfully indignant  ashamed of every sensation
but the one revealed to her  her affection for mr <end> knightley <end>  
every other part of her mind was disgusting <end>

with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every
body s feelings  with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every
body s destiny <end>  she was proved to have been universally mistaken 
and she had not quite done nothing  for she had done mischief <end>
she had brought evil on harriet  on herself  and she too much feared 
on mr <end> knightley <end>  were this most unequal of all connexions to
take place  on her must rest all the reproach of having given it
a beginning  for his attachment  she must believe to be produced only
by a consciousness of harriet s   and even were this not the case 
he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly <end>

mr <end> knightley and harriet smith   it was a union to distance every
wonder of the kind <end>  the attachment of frank churchill and jane
fairfax became commonplace  threadbare  stale in the comparison 
exciting no surprize  presenting no disparity  affording nothing
to be said or thought <end>  mr <end> knightley and harriet smith   such an
elevation on her side   such a debasement on his   it was horrible
to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion 
to foresee the smiles  the sneers  the merriment it would prompt at
his expense  the mortification and disdain of his brother  the thousand
inconveniences to himself <end>  could it be   no  it was impossible <end>
and yet it was far  very far  from impossible <end>  was it a new
circumstance for a man of first rate abilities to be captivated by
very inferior powers   was it new for one  perhaps too busy to seek 
to be the prize of a girl who would seek him   was it new for any
thing in this world to be unequal  inconsistent  incongruous  or for
chance and circumstance  as second causes  to direct the human fate 

oh  had she never brought harriet forward   had she left her where
she ought  and where he had told her she ought   had she not 
with a folly which no tongue could express  prevented her marrying
the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy
and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong  
all would have been safe  none of this dreadful sequel would have been <end>

how harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise
her thoughts to mr <end> knightley   how she could dare to fancy
herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it   
but harriet was less humble  had fewer scruples than formerly <end>  
her inferiority  whether of mind or situation  seemed little felt <end>  
she had seemed more sensible of mr <end> elton s being to stoop
in marrying her  than she now seemed of mr <end> knightley s <end>  
alas  was not that her own doing too   who had been at pains to give
harriet notions of self consequence but herself   who but herself
had taught her  that she was to elevate herself if possible 
and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment   
if harriet  from being humble  were grown vain  it was her doing too <end>



chapter xii


till now that she was threatened with its loss  emma had never known
how much of her happiness depended on being  first  with mr <end> knightley 
first in interest and affection <end>  satisfied that it was so 
and feeling it her due  she had enjoyed it without reflection 
and only in the dread of being supplanted  found how inexpressibly
important it had been <end>  long  very long  she felt she had been first 
for  having no female connexions of his own  there had been
only isabella whose claims could be compared with hers  and she
had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella <end>
she had herself been first with him for many years past <end>
she had not deserved it  she had often been negligent or perverse 
slighting his advice  or even wilfully opposing him  insensible of
half his merits  and quarrelling with him because he would not
acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own  but still 
from family attachment and habit  and thorough excellence of mind 
he had loved her  and watched over her from a girl  with an endeavour
to improve her  and an anxiety for her doing right  which no
other creature had at all shared <end>  in spite of all her faults 
she knew she was dear to him  might she not say  very dear   
when the suggestions of hope  however  which must follow here 
presented themselves  she could not presume to indulge them <end>
harriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly 
exclusively  passionately loved by mr <end> knightley <end>   she  could not <end>
she could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment
to  her  <end>  she had received a very recent proof of its impartiality <end>  
how shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates   how directly 
how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject   not too
strongly for the offence  but far  far too strongly to issue from
any feeling softer than upright justice and clear sighted goodwill <end>  
she had no hope  nothing to deserve the name of hope  that he could
have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question 
but there was a hope  at times a slight one  at times much stronger  
that harriet might have deceived herself  and be overrating his
regard for  her  <end>  wish it she must  for his sake  be the consequence
nothing to herself  but his remaining single all his life <end>
could she be secure of that  indeed  of his never marrying at all 
she believed she should be perfectly satisfied <end>  let him but continue
the same mr <end> knightley to her and her father  the same mr <end> knightley
to all the world  let donwell and hartfield lose none of their
precious intercourse of friendship and confidence  and her peace
would be fully secured <end>  marriage  in fact  would not do for her <end>
it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father  and with
what she felt for him <end>  nothing should separate her from her father <end>
she would not marry  even if she were asked by mr <end> knightley <end>

it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed 
and she hoped  that when able to see them together again  she might at
least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were <end>  she should
see them henceforward with the closest observance  and wretchedly
as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching 
she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here <end>  
he was expected back every day <end>  the power of observation would be
soon given  frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in
one course <end>  in the meanwhile  she resolved against seeing harriet <end>  
it would do neither of them good  it would do the subject no good 
to be talking of it farther <end>  she was resolved not to be convinced 
as long as she could doubt  and yet had no authority for opposing
harriet s confidence <end>  to talk would be only to irritate <end>  she wrote
to her  therefore  kindly  but decisively  to beg that she would not 
at present  come to hartfield  acknowledging it to be her conviction 
that all farther confidential discussion of  one  topic had better
be avoided  and hoping  that if a few days were allowed to pass before
they met again  except in the company of others  she objected only
to a tete a tete  they might be able to act as if they had forgotten
the conversation of yesterday <end>  harriet submitted  and approved 
and was grateful <end>

this point was just arranged  when a visitor arrived to tear emma s
thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them 
sleeping or waking  the last twenty four hours  mrs <end> weston  who had
been calling on her daughter in law elect  and took hartfield in her
way home  almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself 
to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview <end>

mr <end> weston had accompanied her to mrs <end> bates s  and gone through his
share of this essential attention most handsomely  but she having
then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing  was now returned
with much more to say  and much more to say with satisfaction 
than a quarter of an hour spent in mrs <end> bates s parlour  with all
the encumbrance of awkward feelings  could have afforded <end>

a little curiosity emma had  and she made the most of it while
her friend related <end>  mrs <end> weston had set off to pay the visit
in a good deal of agitation herself  and in the first place had
wished not to go at all at present  to be allowed merely to write
to miss fairfax instead  and to defer this ceremonious call till
a little time had passed  and mr <end> churchill could be reconciled
to the engagement s becoming known  as  considering every thing 
she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports   
but mr <end> weston had thought differently  he was extremely anxious
to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family  and did not
conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it  or if it were 
that it would be of any consequence  for  such things   he observed 
 always got about <end>   emma smiled  and felt that mr <end> weston had
very good reason for saying so <end>  they had gone  in short  and very
great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady <end>
she had hardly been able to speak a word  and every look and action
had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness <end>  the quiet 
heart felt satisfaction of the old lady  and the rapturous delight
of her daughter  who proved even too joyous to talk as usual 
had been a gratifying  yet almost an affecting  scene <end>  they were
both so truly respectable in their happiness  so disinterested
in every sensation  thought so much of jane  so much of every body 
and so little of themselves  that every kindly feeling was at work
for them <end>  miss fairfax s recent illness had offered a fair plea
for mrs <end> weston to invite her to an airing  she had drawn back and
declined at first  but  on being pressed had yielded  and  in the
course of their drive  mrs <end> weston had  by gentle encouragement 
overcome so much of her embarrassment  as to bring her to converse
on the important subject <end>  apologies for her seemingly ungracious
silence in their first reception  and the warmest expressions of the
gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr <end> weston 
must necessarily open the cause  but when these effusions were put by 
they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state
of the engagement <end>  mrs <end> weston was convinced that such conversation
must be the greatest relief to her companion  pent up within her own
mind as every thing had so long been  and was very much pleased
with all that she had said on the subject <end>

 on the misery of what she had suffered  during the concealment
of so many months   continued mrs <end> weston   she was energetic <end>
this was one of her expressions <end>   i will not say  that since i
entered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments  but i
can say  that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour    
and the quivering lip  emma  which uttered it  was an attestation
that i felt at my heart <end> 

 poor girl   said emma <end>   she thinks herself wrong  then  for having
consented to a private engagement  

 wrong   no one  i believe  can blame her more than she is disposed
to blame herself <end>   the consequence   said she   has been a state
of perpetual suffering to me  and so it ought <end>  but after all the
punishment that misconduct can bring  it is still not less misconduct <end>
pain is no expiation <end>  i never can be blameless <end>  i have been acting
contrary to all my sense of right  and the fortunate turn that every
thing has taken  and the kindness i am now receiving  is what my
conscience tells me ought not to be <end>    do not imagine  madam  
she continued   that i was taught wrong <end>  do not let any reflection
fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought
me up <end>  the error has been all my own  and i do assure you that 
with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give 
i shall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell <end>  

 poor girl   said emma again <end>   she loves him then excessively 
i suppose <end>  it must have been from attachment only  that she could
be led to form the engagement <end>  her affection must have overpowered
her judgment <end> 

 yes  i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him <end> 

 i am afraid   returned emma  sighing   that i must often have
contributed to make her unhappy <end> 

 on your side  my love  it was very innocently done <end>  but she
probably had something of that in her thoughts  when alluding
to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before <end>
one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in  
she said   was that of making her  unreasonable  <end>  the consciousness
of having done amiss  had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes 
and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been  
that had been  hard for him to bear <end>   i did not make the allowances  
said she   which i ought to have done  for his temper and spirits  
his delightful spirits  and that gaiety  that playfulness
of disposition  which  under any other circumstances  would  i am sure 
have been as constantly bewitching to me  as they were at first <end> 
she then began to speak of you  and of the great kindness you
had shewn her during her illness  and with a blush which shewed me
how it was all connected  desired me  whenever i had an opportunity 
to thank you  i could not thank you too much  for every wish and
every endeavour to do her good <end>  she was sensible that you had never
received any proper acknowledgment from herself <end> 

 if i did not know her to be happy now   said emma  seriously 
 which  in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous
conscience  she must be  i could not bear these thanks   for  oh 
mrs <end> weston  if there were an account drawn up of the evil
and the good i have done miss fairfax   well  checking herself 
and trying to be more lively   this is all to be forgotten <end>
you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars <end>
they shew her to the greatest advantage <end>  i am sure she is very good  
i hope she will be very happy <end>  it is fit that the fortune
should be on his side  for i think the merit will be all on hers <end> 

such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs <end> weston <end>
she thought well of frank in almost every respect  and  what was more 
she loved him very much  and her defence was  therefore  earnest <end>
she talked with a great deal of reason  and at least equal affection  
but she had too much to urge for emma s attention  it was soon gone
to brunswick square or to donwell  she forgot to attempt to listen 
and when mrs <end> weston ended with   we have not yet had the letter
we are so anxious for  you know  but i hope it will soon come  
she was obliged to pause before she answered  and at last obliged
to answer at random  before she could at all recollect what letter it
was which they were so anxious for <end>

 are you well  my emma   was mrs <end> weston s parting question <end>

 oh  perfectly <end>  i am always well  you know <end>  be sure to give me
intelligence of the letter as soon as possible <end> 

mrs <end> weston s communications furnished emma with more food for
unpleasant reflection  by increasing her esteem and compassion 
and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax <end>  she bitterly
regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her  and blushed
for the envious feelings which had certainly been  in some measure 
the cause <end>  had she followed mr <end> knightley s known wishes  in paying
that attention to miss fairfax  which was every way her due  had she
tried to know her better  had she done her part towards intimacy 
had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith 
she must  in all probability  have been spared from every pain
which pressed on her now <end>  birth  abilities  and education 
had been equally marking one as an associate for her  to be received
with gratitude  and the other  what was she   supposing even that
they had never become intimate friends  that she had never been
admitted into miss fairfax s confidence on this important matter  
which was most probable  still  in knowing her as she ought 
and as she might  she must have been preserved from the abominable
suspicions of an improper attachment to mr <end> dixon  which she had
not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself  but had so
unpardonably imparted  an idea which she greatly feared had been made
a subject of material distress to the delicacy of jane s feelings 
by the levity or carelessness of frank churchill s <end>  of all the sources
of evil surrounding the former  since her coming to highbury 
she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst <end>
she must have been a perpetual enemy <end>  they never could have been
all three together  without her having stabbed jane fairfax s peace
in a thousand instances  and on box hill  perhaps  it had been
the agony of a mind that would bear no more <end>

the evening of this day was very long  and melancholy  at hartfield <end>
the weather added what it could of gloom <end>  a cold stormy rain set in 
and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs  which the
wind was despoiling  and the length of the day  which only made
such cruel sights the longer visible <end>

the weather affected mr <end> woodhouse  and he could only be kept tolerably
comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter s side 
and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before <end>
it reminded her of their first forlorn tete a tete  on the evening
of mrs <end> weston s wedding day  but mr <end> knightley had walked
in then  soon after tea  and dissipated every melancholy fancy <end>
alas  such delightful proofs of hartfield s attraction  as those
sort of visits conveyed  might shortly be over <end>  the picture which
she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter 
had proved erroneous  no friends had deserted them  no pleasures
had been lost <end>  but her present forebodings she feared would
experience no similar contradiction <end>  the prospect before her now 
was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled  
that might not be even partially brightened <end>  if all took place
that might take place among the circle of her friends  hartfield must
be comparatively deserted  and she left to cheer her father with the
spirits only of ruined happiness <end>

the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer
than herself  and mrs <end> weston s heart and time would be occupied
by it <end>  they should lose her  and  probably  in great measure 
her husband also <end>  frank churchill would return among them no more 
and miss fairfax  it was reasonable to suppose  would soon cease
to belong to highbury <end>  they would be married  and settled either
at or near enscombe <end>  all that were good would be withdrawn  and if
to these losses  the loss of donwell were to be added  what would
remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach 
mr <end> knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort   
no longer walking in at all hours  as if ever willing to change
his own home for their s   how was it to be endured   and if he were
to be lost to them for harriet s sake  if he were to be thought
of hereafter  as finding in harriet s society all that he wanted 
if harriet were to be the chosen  the first  the dearest  the friend 
the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence 
what could be increasing emma s wretchedness but the reflection never far
distant from her mind  that it had been all her own work 

when it came to such a pitch as this  she was not able to refrain
from a start  or a heavy sigh  or even from walking about the room
for a few seconds  and the only source whence any thing like consolation
or composure could be drawn  was in the resolution of her own
better conduct  and the hope that  however inferior in spirit and
gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life
to the past  it would yet find her more rational  more acquainted
with herself  and leave her less to regret when it were gone <end>



chapter xiii


the weather continued much the same all the following morning 
and the same loneliness  and the same melancholy  seemed to
reign at hartfield  but in the afternoon it cleared  the wind
changed into a softer quarter  the clouds were carried off 
the sun appeared  it was summer again <end>  with all the eagerness
which such a transition gives  emma resolved to be out of doors
as soon as possible <end>  never had the exquisite sight  smell 
sensation of nature  tranquil  warm  and brilliant after a storm 
been more attractive to her <end>  she longed for the serenity they might
gradually introduce  and on mr <end> perry s coming in soon after dinner 
with a disengaged hour to give her father  she lost no time ill
hurrying into the shrubbery <end>  there  with spirits freshened 
and thoughts a little relieved  she had taken a few turns  when she
saw mr <end> knightley passing through the garden door  and coming
towards her <end>  it was the first intimation of his being returned
from london <end>  she had been thinking of him the moment before 
as unquestionably sixteen miles distant <end>  there was time only for
the quickest arrangement of mind <end>  she must be collected and calm <end>
in half a minute they were together <end>  the  how d ye do s  were quiet
and constrained on each side <end>  she asked after their mutual friends 
they were all well <end>  when had he left them   only that morning <end>
he must have had a wet ride <end>  yes <end>  he meant to walk with her 
she found <end>   he had just looked into the dining room  and as he
was not wanted there  preferred being out of doors <end>   she thought
he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully  and the first possible
cause for it  suggested by her fears  was  that he had perhaps been
communicating his plans to his brother  and was pained by the manner
in which they had been received <end>

they walked together <end>  he was silent <end>  she thought he was often
looking at her  and trying for a fuller view of her face than it
suited her to give <end>  and this belief produced another dread <end>
perhaps he wanted to speak to her  of his attachment to harriet 
he might be watching for encouragement to begin <end>  she did not 
could not  feel equal to lead the way to any such subject <end>
he must do it all himself <end>  yet she could not bear this silence <end>
with him it was most unnatural <end>  she considered  resolved  and  trying
to smile  began  

 you have some news to hear  now you are come back  that will rather
surprize you <end> 

 have i   said he quietly  and looking at her   of what nature  

 oh  the best nature in the world  a wedding <end> 

after waiting a moment  as if to be sure she intended to say no more 
he replied 

 if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill  i have heard
that already <end> 

 how is it possible   cried emma  turning her glowing cheeks
towards him  for  while she spoke  it occurred to her that he
might have called at mrs <end> goddard s in his way <end>

 i had a few lines on parish business from mr <end> weston this morning 
and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened <end> 

emma was quite relieved  and could presently say  with a little
more composure 

  you  probably have been less surprized than any of us  for you have
had your suspicions <end>  i have not forgotten that you once tried to give
me a caution <end>  i wish i had attended to it  but   with a sinking
voice and a heavy sigh  i seem to have been doomed to blindness <end> 

for a moment or two nothing was said  and she was unsuspicious
of having excited any particular interest  till she found her arm
drawn within his  and pressed against his heart  and heard him
thus saying  in a tone of great sensibility  speaking low 

 time  my dearest emma  time will heal the wound <end>  your own
excellent sense  your exertions for your father s sake  i know
you will not allow yourself   <end>   her arm was pressed again 
as he added  in a more broken and subdued accent   the feelings
of the warmest friendship  indignation  abominable scoundrel    
and in a louder  steadier tone  he concluded with   he will soon
be gone <end>  they will soon be in yorkshire <end>  i am sorry for  her  <end>
she deserves a better fate <end> 

emma understood him  and as soon as she could recover from the
flutter of pleasure  excited by such tender consideration  replied 

 you are very kind  but you are mistaken  and i must set you right <end>  
i am not in want of that sort of compassion <end>  my blindness to what
was going on  led me to act by them in a way that i must always
be ashamed of  and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many
things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures  but i
have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier <end> 

 emma   cried he  looking eagerly at her   are you  indeed    
but checking himself   no  no  i understand you  forgive me  i am
pleased that you can say even so much <end>  he is no object of regret 
indeed  and it will not be very long  i hope  before that becomes
the acknowledgment of more than your reason <end>  fortunate that your
affections were not farther entangled   i could never  i confess 
from your manners  assure myself as to the degree of what you felt  
i could only be certain that there was a preference  and a preference
which i never believed him to deserve <end>  he is a disgrace to the name
of man <end>  and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman   
jane  jane  you will be a miserable creature <end> 

 mr <end> knightley   said emma  trying to be lively  but really confused  
 i am in a very extraordinary situation <end>  i cannot let you continue in
your error  and yet  perhaps  since my manners gave such an impression 
i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have
been at all attached to the person we are speaking of  as it might
be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse <end>  
but i never have <end> 

he listened in perfect silence <end>  she wished him to speak  but he
would not <end>  she supposed she must say more before she were entitled
to his clemency  but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower
herself in his opinion <end>  she went on  however <end>

 i have very little to say for my own conduct <end>  i was tempted
by his attentions  and allowed myself to appear pleased <end>  
an old story  probably  a common case  and no more than has happened
to hundreds of my sex before  and yet it may not be the more excusable
in one who sets up as i do for understanding <end>  many circumstances
assisted the temptation <end>  he was the son of mr <end> weston  he was
continually here  i always found him very pleasant  and  in short 
for  with a sigh  let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously 
they all centre in this at last  my vanity was flattered  and i
allowed his attentions <end>  latterly  however  for some time  indeed  
i have had no idea of their meaning any thing <end>  i thought them
a habit  a trick  nothing that called for seriousness on my side <end>
he has imposed on me  but he has not injured me <end>  i have never been
attached to him <end>  and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour <end>
he never wished to attach me <end>  it was merely a blind to conceal
his real situation with another <end>  it was his object to blind
all about him  and no one  i am sure  could be more effectually
blinded than myself  except that i was  not  blinded  that it was my
good fortune  that  in short  i was somehow or other safe from him <end> 

she had hoped for an answer here  for a few words to say that her
conduct was at least intelligible  but he was silent  and  as far
as she could judge  deep in thought <end>  at last  and tolerably
in his usual tone  he said 

 i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill <end>  i can suppose 
however  that i may have underrated him <end>  my acquaintance with
him has been but trifling <end>  and even if i have not underrated
him hitherto  he may yet turn out well <end>  with such a woman he has
a chance <end>  i have no motive for wishing him ill  and for her sake 
whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct 
i shall certainly wish him well <end> 

 i have no doubt of their being happy together   said emma 
 i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached <end> 

 he is a most fortunate man   returned mr <end> knightley  with energy <end>
 so early in life  at three and twenty  a period when  if a man
chuses a wife  he generally chuses ill <end>  at three and twenty
to have drawn such a prize   what years of felicity that man 
in all human calculation  has before him   assured of the love of
such a woman  the disinterested love  for jane fairfax s character
vouches for her disinterestedness  every thing in his favour   
equality of situation  i mean  as far as regards society  and all the
habits and manners that are important  equality in every point but one  
and that one  since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted 
such as must increase his felicity  for it will be his to bestow the
only advantages she wants <end>  a man would always wish to give a woman
a better home than the one he takes her from  and he who can do it 
where there is no doubt of  her  regard  must  i think  be the happiest
of mortals <end>  frank churchill is  indeed  the favourite of fortune <end>
every thing turns out for his good <end>  he meets with a young woman
at a watering place  gains her affection  cannot even weary her
by negligent treatment  and had he and all his family sought round
the world for a perfect wife for him  they could not have found
her superior <end>  his aunt is in the way <end>  his aunt dies <end>  he has
only to speak <end>  his friends are eager to promote his happiness <end>  
he had used every body ill  and they are all delighted to forgive him <end>  
he is a fortunate man indeed  

 you speak as if you envied him <end> 

 and i do envy him  emma <end>  in one respect he is the object of my envy <end> 

emma could say no more <end>  they seemed to be within half a sentence
of harriet  and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject 
if possible <end>  she made her plan  she would speak of something
totally different  the children in brunswick square  and she
only waited for breath to begin  when mr <end> knightley startled her 
by saying 

 you will not ask me what is the point of envy <end>  you are determined 
i see  to have no curiosity <end>  you are wise  but  i  cannot be wise <end>
emma  i must tell you what you will not ask  though i may wish it
unsaid the next moment <end> 

 oh  then  don t speak it  don t speak it   she eagerly cried <end>
 take a little time  consider  do not commit yourself <end> 

 thank you   said he  in an accent of deep mortification  and not
another syllable followed <end>

emma could not bear to give him pain <end>  he was wishing to confide in her  
perhaps to consult her   cost her what it would  she would listen <end>
she might assist his resolution  or reconcile him to it 
she might give just praise to harriet  or  by representing to him
his own independence  relieve him from that state of indecision 
which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind
as his <end>  they had reached the house <end>

 you are going in  i suppose   said he <end>

 no    replied emma  quite confirmed by the depressed manner
in which he still spoke   i should like to take another turn <end>
mr <end> perry is not gone <end>   and  after proceeding a few steps  she added  
 i stopped you ungraciously  just now  mr <end> knightley  and  i am afraid 
gave you pain <end>  but if you have any wish to speak openly to me
as a friend  or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have
in contemplation  as a friend  indeed  you may command me <end>  i will
hear whatever you like <end>  i will tell you exactly what i think <end> 

 as a friend    repeated mr <end> knightley <end>   emma  that i fear is
a word  no  i have no wish  stay  yes  why should i hesitate   
i have gone too far already for concealment <end>  emma  i accept your offer  
extraordinary as it may seem  i accept it  and refer myself to you
as a friend <end>  tell me  then  have i no chance of ever succeeding  

he stopped in his earnestness to look the question  and the expression
of his eyes overpowered her <end>

 my dearest emma   said he   for dearest you will always be 
whatever the event of this hour s conversation  my dearest 
most beloved emma  tell me at once <end>  say  no   if it is to be said <end>   
she could really say nothing <end>   you are silent   he cried 
with great animation   absolutely silent  at present i ask no more <end> 

emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment <end>
the dread of being awakened from the happiest dream  was perhaps
the most prominent feeling <end>

 i cannot make speeches  emma    he soon resumed  and in a tone
of such sincere  decided  intelligible tenderness as was
tolerably convincing <end>   if i loved you less  i might be able
to talk about it more <end>  but you know what i am <end>  you hear nothing
but truth from me <end>  i have blamed you  and lectured you  and you
have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it <end>  
bear with the truths i would tell you now  dearest emma  as well as
you have borne with them <end>  the manner  perhaps  may have as little
to recommend them <end>  god knows  i have been a very indifferent lover <end>  
but you understand me <end>  yes  you see  you understand my feelings  
and will return them if you can <end>  at present  i ask only to hear 
once to hear your voice <end> 

while he spoke  emma s mind was most busy  and  with all the wonderful
velocity of thought  had been able  and yet without losing a word  
to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole  to see that
harriet s hopes had been entirely groundless  a mistake  a delusion 
as complete a delusion as any of her own  that harriet was nothing 
that she was every thing herself  that what she had been saying
relative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her
own feelings  and that her agitation  her doubts  her reluctance 
her discouragement  had been all received as discouragement
from herself <end>  and not only was there time for these convictions 
with all their glow of attendant happiness  there was time also to
rejoice that harriet s secret had not escaped her  and to resolve
that it need not  and should not <end>  it was all the service she could
now render her poor friend  for as to any of that heroism of sentiment
which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection
from herself to harriet  as infinitely the most worthy of the two  
or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him
at once and for ever  without vouchsafing any motive  because he
could not marry them both  emma had it not <end>  she felt for harriet 
with pain and with contrition  but no flight of generosity run mad 
opposing all that could be probable or reasonable  entered her brain <end>
she had led her friend astray  and it would be a reproach to
her for ever  but her judgment was as strong as her feelings 
and as strong as it had ever been before  in reprobating any such
alliance for him  as most unequal and degrading <end>  her way was clear 
though not quite smooth <end>  she spoke then  on being so entreated <end>  
what did she say   just what she ought  of course <end>  a lady always does <end>  
she said enough to shew there need not be despair  and to invite him
to say more himself <end>  he  had  despaired at one period  he had received
such an injunction to caution and silence  as for the time crushed
every hope   she had begun by refusing to hear him <end>  the change had
perhaps been somewhat sudden   her proposal of taking another turn 
her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to 
might be a little extraordinary   she felt its inconsistency 
but mr <end> knightley was so obliging as to put up with it  and seek no
farther explanation <end>

seldom  very seldom  does complete truth belong to any human disclosure 
seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised 
or a little mistaken  but where  as in this case  though the conduct
is mistaken  the feelings are not  it may not be very material <end>  
mr <end> knightley could not impute to emma a more relenting heart than
she possessed  or a heart more disposed to accept of his <end>

he had  in fact  been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence <end>
he had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it <end>
he had come  in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchill s
engagement  with no selfish view  no view at all  but of endeavouring 
if she allowed him an opening  to soothe or to counsel her <end>  the rest
had been the work of the moment  the immediate effect of what he heard 
on his feelings <end>  the delightful assurance of her total indifference
towards frank churchill  of her having a heart completely disengaged
from him  had given birth to the hope  that  in time  he might gain
her affection himself   but it had been no present hope  he had only 
in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment  aspired to be
told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her <end>  the superior
hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting <end>  
the affection  which he had been asking to be allowed to create 
if he could  was already his   within half an hour  he had passed
from a thoroughly distressed state of mind  to something so like
perfect happiness  that it could bear no other name <end>

 her  change was equal <end>  this one half hour had given to each the
same precious certainty of being beloved  had cleared from each
the same degree of ignorance  jealousy  or distrust <end>  on his side 
there had been a long standing jealousy  old as the arrival 
or even the expectation  of frank churchill <end>  he had been in love
with emma  and jealous of frank churchill  from about the same period 
one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other <end>
it was his jealousy of frank churchill that had taken him from
the country <end>  the box hill party had decided him on going away <end>
he would save himself from witnessing again such permitted 
encouraged attentions <end>  he had gone to learn to be indifferent <end>  
but he had gone to a wrong place <end>  there was too much domestic
happiness in his brother s house  woman wore too amiable a form in it 
isabella was too much like emma  differing only in those striking
inferiorities  which always brought the other in brilliancy before him 
for much to have been done  even had his time been longer <end>  he had
stayed on  however  vigorously  day after day  till this very morning s
post had conveyed the history of jane fairfax <end>  then  with the
gladness which must be felt  nay  which he did not scruple to feel 
having never believed frank churchill to be at all deserving emma 
was there so much fond solicitude  so much keen anxiety for her 
that he could stay no longer <end>  he had ridden home through the rain 
and had walked up directly after dinner  to see how this sweetest
and best of all creatures  faultless in spite of all her faults 
bore the discovery <end>

he had found her agitated and low <end>  frank churchill was a villain <end>  
he heard her declare that she had never loved him <end>  frank churchill s
character was not desperate <end>  she was his own emma  by hand and word 
when they returned into the house  and if he could have thought
of frank churchill then  he might have deemed him a very good sort
of fellow <end>



chapter xiv


what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house
from what she had brought out   she had then been only daring to hope
for a little respite of suffering   she was now in an exquisite
flutter of happiness  and such happiness moreover as she believed
must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away <end>

they sat down to tea  the same party round the same table  
how often it had been collected   and how often had her eyes fallen
on the same shrubs in the lawn  and observed the same beautiful
effect of the western sun   but never in such a state of spirits 
never in any thing like it  and it was with difficulty that she could
summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house 
or even the attentive daughter <end>

poor mr <end> woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him
in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming  and so
anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride <end>  could he
have seen the heart  he would have cared very little for the lungs 
but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil 
without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in
the looks or ways of either  he repeated to them very comfortably
all the articles of news he had received from mr <end> perry  and talked
on with much self contentment  totally unsuspicious of what they
could have told him in return <end>

as long as mr <end> knightley remained with them  emma s fever continued 
but when he was gone  she began to be a little tranquillised
and subdued  and in the course of the sleepless night  which was
the tax for such an evening  she found one or two such very serious
points to consider  as made her feel  that even her happiness
must have some alloy <end>  her father  and harriet <end>  she could not be
alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims 
and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost  was the question <end>
with respect to her father  it was a question soon answered <end>
she hardly knew yet what mr <end> knightley would ask  but a very short
parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution
of never quitting her father <end>  she even wept over the idea of it 
as a sin of thought <end>  while he lived  it must be only an engagement 
but she flattered herself  that if divested of the danger of
drawing her away  it might become an increase of comfort to him <end>  
how to do her best by harriet  was of more difficult decision   
how to spare her from any unnecessary pain  how to make
her any possible atonement  how to appear least her enemy   
on these subjects  her perplexity and distress were very great  
and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter
reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it <end>  
she could only resolve at last  that she would still avoid a
meeting with her  and communicate all that need be told by letter 
that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just
now for a time from highbury  and  indulging in one scheme more  
nearly resolve  that it might be practicable to get an invitation
for her to brunswick square <end>  isabella had been pleased with harriet 
and a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusement <end>  
she did not think it in harriet s nature to escape being benefited
by novelty and variety  by the streets  the shops  and the children <end>  
at any rate  it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself 
from whom every thing was due  a separation for the present  an averting
of the evil day  when they must all be together again <end>

she rose early  and wrote her letter to harriet  an employment
which left her so very serious  so nearly sad  that mr <end> knightley 
in walking up to hartfield to breakfast  did not arrive at all too soon 
and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again
with him  literally and figuratively  was quite necessary to reinstate
her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before <end>

he had not left her long  by no means long enough for her to have
the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else  when a letter
was brought her from randalls  a very thick letter   she guessed
what it must contain  and deprecated the necessity of reading it <end>  
she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill  she wanted
no explanations  she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself  
and as for understanding any thing he wrote  she was sure she was
incapable of it <end>  it must be waded through  however <end>  she opened
the packet  it was too surely so   a note from mrs <end> weston to herself 
ushered in the letter from frank to mrs <end> weston <end>

 i have the greatest pleasure  my dear emma  in forwarding
to you the enclosed <end>  i know what thorough justice you will
do it  and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect <end>  i think
we shall never materially disagree about the writer again 
but i will not delay you by a long preface <end>  we are quite well <end>  
this letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness i have
been feeling lately <end>  i did not quite like your looks on tuesday 
but it was an ungenial morning  and though you will never own being
affected by weather  i think every body feels a north east wind <end>  
i felt for your dear father very much in the storm of tuesday
afternoon and yesterday morning  but had the comfort of hearing
last night  by mr <end> perry  that it had not made him ill <end>
                               yours ever 
                                                        a <end> w <end> 

                        to mrs <end> weston <end> 
                                                       windsor july <end>
my dear madam 

 if i made myself intelligible yesterday  this letter will be expected 
but expected or not  i know it will be read with candour and indulgence <end>  
you are all goodness  and i believe there will be need of even
all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct <end>  
but i have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent <end>
my courage rises while i write <end>  it is very difficult for the
prosperous to be humble <end>  i have already met with such success
in two applications for pardon  that i may be in danger of thinking
myself too sure of yours  and of those among your friends who have
had any ground of offence <end>  you must all endeavour to comprehend
the exact nature of my situation when i first arrived at randalls 
you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept
at all hazards <end>  this was the fact <end>  my right to place myself
in a situation requiring such concealment  is another question <end>
i shall not discuss it here <end>  for my temptation to  think  it a right 
i refer every caviller to a brick house  sashed windows below 
and casements above  in highbury <end>  i dared not address her openly 
my difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well
known to require definition  and i was fortunate enough to prevail 
before we parted at weymouth  and to induce the most upright female
mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement <end>  
had she refused  i should have gone mad <end>  but you will be ready to say 
what was your hope in doing this   what did you look forward to   
to any thing  every thing  to time  chance  circumstance  slow effects 
sudden bursts  perseverance and weariness  health and sickness <end>
every possibility of good was before me  and the first of blessings
secured  in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence <end>
if you need farther explanation  i have the honour  my dear madam 
of being your husband s son  and the advantage of inheriting
a disposition to hope for good  which no inheritance of houses
or lands can ever equal the value of <end>  see me  then  under these
circumstances  arriving on my first visit to randalls   and here i
am conscious of wrong  for that visit might have been sooner paid <end>
you will look back and see that i did not come till miss fairfax
was in highbury  and as  you  were the person slighted  you will
forgive me instantly  but i must work on my father s compassion 
by reminding him  that so long as i absented myself from his house 
so long i lost the blessing of knowing you <end>  my behaviour 
during the very happy fortnight which i spent with you  did not 
i hope  lay me open to reprehension  excepting on one point <end>
and now i come to the principal  the only important part of my
conduct while belonging to you  which excites my own anxiety 
or requires very solicitous explanation <end>  with the greatest respect 
and the warmest friendship  do i mention miss woodhouse  my father
perhaps will think i ought to add  with the deepest humiliation <end>  
a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion 
and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to <end>  my behaviour
to miss woodhouse indicated  i believe  more than it ought <end>  
in order to assist a concealment so essential to me  i was led
on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy
into which we were immediately thrown <end>  i cannot deny that miss
woodhouse was my ostensible object  but i am sure you will believe
the declaration  that had i not been convinced of her indifference 
i would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on <end>  
amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is  she never gave me
the idea of a young woman likely to be attached  and that she was
perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me  was as much
my conviction as my wish <end>  she received my attentions with an easy 
friendly  goodhumoured playfulness  which exactly suited me <end>
we seemed to understand each other <end>  from our relative situation 
those attentions were her due  and were felt to be so <end>  whether miss
woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of
that fortnight  i cannot say   when i called to take leave of her 
i remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth 
and i then fancied she was not without suspicion  but i have no
doubt of her having since detected me  at least in some degree <end>  
she may not have surmised the whole  but her quickness must
have penetrated a part <end>  i cannot doubt it <end>  you will find 
whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints 
that it did not take her wholly by surprize <end>  she frequently gave
me hints of it <end>  i remember her telling me at the ball  that i
owed mrs <end> elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax <end>  
i hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted
by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss <end>
while you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse 
i could deserve nothing from either <end>  acquit me here  and procure
for me  when it is allowable  the acquittal and good wishes of that
said emma woodhouse  whom i regard with so much brotherly affection 
as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself <end>  
whatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight  you have
now a key to <end>  my heart was in highbury  and my business was to get
my body thither as often as might be  and with the least suspicion <end>
if you remember any queernesses  set them all to the right account <end>  
of the pianoforte so much talked of  i feel it only necessary to say 
that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f    who would
never have allowed me to send it  had any choice been given her <end>  
the delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement 
my dear madam  is much beyond my power of doing justice to <end>
you will soon  i earnestly hope  know her thoroughly yourself <end>  
no description can describe her <end>  she must tell you herself what she is  
yet not by word  for never was there a human creature who would
so designedly suppress her own merit <end>  since i began this letter 
which will be longer than i foresaw  i have heard from her <end>  
she gives a good account of her own health  but as she never complains 
i dare not depend <end>  i want to have your opinion of her looks <end>
i know you will soon call on her  she is living in dread of the visit <end>
perhaps it is paid already <end>  let me hear from you without delay 
i am impatient for a thousand particulars <end>  remember how few
minutes i was at randalls  and in how bewildered  how mad a state 
and i am not much better yet  still insane either from happiness
or misery <end>  when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with 
of her excellence and patience  and my uncle s generosity  i am mad
with joy   but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her 
and how little i deserve to be forgiven  i am mad with anger <end>
if i could but see her again   but i must not propose it yet <end>
my uncle has been too good for me to encroach <end>  i must still add
to this long letter <end>  you have not heard all that you ought to hear <end>
i could not give any connected detail yesterday  but the suddenness 
and  in one light  the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out 
needs explanation  for though the event of the 26th ult <end>  as you
will conclude  immediately opened to me the happiest prospects 
i should not have presumed on such early measures  but from the
very particular circumstances  which left me not an hour to lose <end>
i should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty  and she would have
felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement <end>  
but i had no choice <end>  the hasty engagement she had entered into with
that woman  here  my dear madam  i was obliged to leave off abruptly 
to recollect and compose myself <end>  i have been walking over the country 
and am now  i hope  rational enough to make the rest of my letter
what it ought to be <end>  it is  in fact  a most mortifying retrospect
for me <end>  i behaved shamefully <end>  and here i can admit  that my manners
to miss w <end>  in being unpleasant to miss f <end>  were highly blameable <end>
 she  disapproved them  which ought to have been enough <end>  my plea of
concealing the truth she did not think sufficient <end>  she was displeased 
i thought unreasonably so   i thought her  on a thousand occasions 
unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious   i thought her even cold <end>
but she was always right <end>  if i had followed her judgment  and subdued
my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper  i should have
escaped the greatest unhappiness i have ever known <end>  we quarrelled <end>  
do you remember the morning spent at donwell    there  every little
dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis <end>  i was late 
i met her walking home by herself  and wanted to walk with her 
but she would not suffer it <end>  she absolutely refused to allow me 
which i then thought most unreasonable <end>  now  however  i see nothing
in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion <end>
while i  to blind the world to our engagement  was behaving one
hour with objectionable particularity to another woman  was she
to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made
every previous caution useless   had we been met walking together
between donwell and highbury  the truth must have been suspected <end>  
i was mad enough  however  to resent <end>  i doubted her affection <end>
i doubted it more the next day on box hill  when  provoked by
such conduct on my side  such shameful  insolent neglect of her 
and such apparent devotion to miss w <end>  as it would have been
impossible for any woman of sense to endure  she spoke her
resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me <end>  
in short  my dear madam  it was a quarrel blameless on her side 
abominable on mine  and i returned the same evening to richmond 
though i might have staid with you till the next morning 
merely because i would be as angry with her as possible <end>  even then 
i was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time 
but i was the injured person  injured by her coldness  and i went
away determined that she should make the first advances <end>  i shall
always congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party <end>
had you witnessed my behaviour there  i can hardly suppose you would
ever have thought well of me again <end>  its effect upon her appears
in the immediate resolution it produced   as soon as she found i
was really gone from randalls  she closed with the offer of that
officious mrs <end> elton  the whole system of whose treatment of her 
by the bye  has ever filled me with indignation and hatred <end>
i must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been
so richly extended towards myself  but  otherwise  i should loudly
protest against the share of it which that woman has known <end>  
 jane   indeed   you will observe that i have not yet indulged myself
in calling her by that name  even to you <end>  think  then  what i must
have endured in hearing it bandied between the eltons with all
the vulgarity of needless repetition  and all the insolence of
imaginary superiority <end>  have patience with me  i shall soon have done <end>  
she closed with this offer  resolving to break with me entirely 
and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again <end>  
 she   felt   the   engagement   to   be   a   source   of   repentance   and   misery 
 to   each     she   dissolved   it  <end>  this letter reached me on the very
morning of my poor aunt s death <end>  i answered it within an hour 
but from the confusion of my mind  and the multiplicity of business
falling on me at once  my answer  instead of being sent with all
the many other letters of that day  was locked up in my writing desk 
and i  trusting that i had written enough  though but a few lines 
to satisfy her  remained without any uneasiness <end>  i was rather
disappointed that i did not hear from her again speedily 
but i made excuses for her  and was too busy  and  may i add   
too cheerful in my views to be captious <end>  we removed to windsor 
and two days afterwards i received a parcel from her  my own letters
all returned   and a few lines at the same time by the post 
stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply
to her last  and adding  that as silence on such a point could
not be misconstrued  and as it must be equally desirable to both
to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible 
she now sent me  by a safe conveyance  all my letters  and requested 
that if i could not directly command hers  so as to send them
to highbury within a week  i would forward them after that period
to her at     in short  the full direction to mr <end> smallridge s 
near bristol  stared me in the face <end>  i knew the name  the place 
i knew all about it  and instantly saw what she had been doing <end>
it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character
which i knew her to possess  and the secrecy she had maintained 
as to any such design in her former letter  was equally descriptive
of its anxious delicacy <end>  for the world would not she have seemed
to threaten me <end>  imagine the shock  imagine how  till i had actually
detected my own blunder  i raved at the blunders of the post <end>  
what was to be done   one thing only <end>  i must speak to my uncle <end>
without his sanction i could not hope to be listened to again <end>  
i spoke  circumstances were in my favour  the late event had softened
away his pride  and he was  earlier than i could have anticipated 
wholly reconciled and complying  and could say at last  poor man 
with a deep sigh  that he wished i might find as much happiness
in the marriage state as he had done <end>  i felt that it would be
of a different sort <end>  are you disposed to pity me for what i must
have suffered in opening the cause to him  for my suspense while
all was at stake   no  do not pity me till i reached highbury 
and saw how ill i had made her <end>  do not pity me till i saw her wan 
sick looks <end>  i reached highbury at the time of day when  from my
knowledge of their late breakfast hour  i was certain of a good chance
of finding her alone <end>  i was not disappointed  and at last i was
not disappointed either in the object of my journey <end>  a great deal
of very reasonable  very just displeasure i had to persuade away <end>
but it is done  we are reconciled  dearer  much dearer  than ever 
and no moment s uneasiness can ever occur between us again <end>  now  my
dear madam  i will release you  but i could not conclude before <end>
a thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have
ever shewn me  and ten thousand for the attentions your heart
will dictate towards her <end>  if you think me in a way to be happier
than i deserve  i am quite of your opinion <end>  miss w <end> calls me
the child of good fortune <end>  i hope she is right <end>  in one respect 
my good fortune is undoubted  that of being able to subscribe
myself 
                    your obliged and affectionate son

chapter xv


this letter must make its way to emma s feelings <end>  she was obliged 
in spite of her previous determination to the contrary  to do
it all the justice that mrs <end> weston foretold <end>  as soon as she
came to her own name  it was irresistible  every line relating
to herself was interesting  and almost every line agreeable 
and when this charm ceased  the subject could still maintain itself 
by the natural return of her former regard for the writer  and the
very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at
that moment <end>  she never stopt till she had gone through the whole 
and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong 
yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed  and he had suffered 
and was very sorry  and he was so grateful to mrs <end> weston 
and so much in love with miss fairfax  and she was so happy herself 
that there was no being severe  and could he have entered the room 
she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever <end>

she thought so well of the letter  that when mr <end> knightley came again 
she desired him to read it <end>  she was sure of mrs <end> weston s wishing
it to be communicated  especially to one  who  like mr <end> knightley 
had seen so much to blame in his conduct <end>

 i shall be very glad to look it over   said he   but it seems long <end>
i will take it home with me at night <end> 

but that would not do <end>  mr <end> weston was to call in the evening 
and she must return it by him <end>

 i would rather be talking to you   he replied   but as it seems
a matter of justice  it shall be done <end> 

he began  stopping  however  almost directly to say   had i been offered
the sight of one of this gentleman s letters to his mother in law a few
months ago  emma  it would not have been taken with such indifference <end> 

he proceeded a little farther  reading to himself  and then 
with a smile  observed   humph  a fine complimentary opening 
but it is his way <end>  one man s style must not be the rule of another s <end>
we will not be severe <end> 

 it will be natural for me   he added shortly afterwards   to speak my
opinion aloud as i read <end>  by doing it  i shall feel that i am near you <end>
it will not be so great a loss of time   but if you dislike it   

 not at all <end>  i should wish it <end> 

mr <end> knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity <end>

 he trifles here   said he   as to the temptation <end>  he knows
he is wrong  and has nothing rational to urge <end>  bad <end>  he ought
not to have formed the engagement <end>   his father s disposition    
he is unjust  however  to his father <end>  mr <end> weston s sanguine
temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions 
but mr <end> weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured
to gain it <end>  very true  he did not come till miss fairfax was here <end> 

 and i have not forgotten   said emma   how sure you were that he
might have come sooner if he would <end>  you pass it over very handsomely  
but you were perfectly right <end> 

 i was not quite impartial in my judgment  emma   but yet  i think  
had  you  not been in the case  i should still have distrusted him <end> 

when he came to miss woodhouse  he was obliged to read the whole
of it aloud  all that related to her  with a smile  a look 
a shake of the head  a word or two of assent  or disapprobation 
or merely of love  as the subject required  concluding  however 
seriously  and  after steady reflection  thus  

 very bad  though it might have been worse <end>  playing a most
dangerous game <end>  too much indebted to the event for his acquittal <end>  
no judge of his own manners by you <end>  always deceived in fact by his
own wishes  and regardless of little besides his own convenience <end>  
fancying you to have fathomed his secret <end>  natural enough   
his own mind full of intrigue  that he should suspect it
in others <end>  mystery  finesse  how they pervert the understanding 
my emma  does not every thing serve to prove more and more the
beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other  

emma agreed to it  and with a blush of sensibility on harriet s account 
which she could not give any sincere explanation of <end>

 you had better go on   said she <end>

he did so  but very soon stopt again to say   the pianoforte 
ah   that was the act of a very  very young man  one too young
to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much
exceed the pleasure <end>  a boyish scheme  indeed   i cannot
comprehend a man s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection
which he knows she would rather dispense with  and he did
know that she would have prevented the instrument s coming if she could <end> 

after this  he made some progress without any pause <end>
frank churchill s confession of having behaved shamefully
was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing <end>

 i perfectly agree with you  sir    was then his remark <end>
 you did behave very shamefully <end>  you never wrote a truer line <end> 
and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis
of their disagreement  and his persisting to act in direct
opposition to jane fairfax s sense of right  he made a fuller pause
to say   this is very bad <end>  he had induced her to place herself 
for his sake  in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness 
and it should have been his first object to prevent her from
suffering unnecessarily <end>  she must have had much more to contend with 
in carrying on the correspondence  than he could <end>  he should have
respected even unreasonable scruples  had there been such  but hers
were all reasonable <end>  we must look to her one fault  and remember
that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement 
to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment <end> 

emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party 
and grew uncomfortable <end>  her own behaviour had been so very improper 
she was deeply ashamed  and a little afraid of his next look <end>
it was all read  however  steadily  attentively  and without
the smallest remark  and  excepting one momentary glance at her 
instantly withdrawn  in the fear of giving pain  no remembrance
of box hill seemed to exist <end>

 there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends 
the eltons   was his next observation <end>   his feelings are natural <end>  
what  actually resolve to break with him entirely   she felt
the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each  
she dissolved it <end>  what a view this gives of her sense of
his behaviour   well  he must be a most extraordinary   

 nay  nay  read on <end>  you will find how very much he suffers <end> 

 i hope he does   replied mr <end> knightley coolly  and resuming the letter <end>
  smallridge    what does this mean   what is all this  

 she had engaged to go as governess to mrs <end> smallridge s children  
a dear friend of mrs <end> elton s  a neighbour of maple grove  and 
by the bye  i wonder how mrs <end> elton bears the disappointment  

 say nothing  my dear emma  while you oblige me to read  not even
of mrs <end> elton <end>  only one page more <end>  i shall soon have done <end>
what a letter the man writes  

 i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him <end> 

 well  there  is  feeling here <end>  he does seem to have suffered in finding
her ill <end>  certainly  i can have no doubt of his being fond of her <end>
 dearer  much dearer than ever <end>   i hope he may long continue to feel
all the value of such a reconciliation <end>  he is a very liberal thanker 
with his thousands and tens of thousands <end>   happier than i deserve <end> 
come  he knows himself there <end>   miss woodhouse calls me the child
of good fortune <end>   those were miss woodhouse s words  were they   
and a fine ending  and there is the letter <end>  the child of good fortune 
that was your name for him  was it  

 you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am 
but still you must  at least i hope you must  think the better
of him for it <end>  i hope it does him some service with you <end> 

 yes  certainly it does <end>  he has had great faults  faults of
inconsideration and thoughtlessness  and i am very much of his
opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves 
but still as he is  beyond a doubt  really attached to miss fairfax 
and will soon  it may be hoped  have the advantage of being constantly
with her  i am very ready to believe his character will improve 
and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle
that it wants <end>  and now  let me talk to you of something else <end>
i have another person s interest at present so much at heart 
that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill <end>  ever since i
left you this morning  emma  my mind has been hard at work on
one subject <end> 

the subject followed  it was in plain  unaffected  gentlemanlike english 
such as mr <end> knightley used even to the woman he was in love with 
how to be able to ask her to marry him  without attacking the
happiness of her father <end>  emma s answer was ready at the first word <end>
 while her dear father lived  any change of condition must be impossible
for her <end>  she could never quit him <end>   part only of this answer 
however  was admitted <end>  the impossibility of her quitting her father 
mr <end> knightley felt as strongly as herself  but the inadmissibility
of any other change  he could not agree to <end>  he had been thinking
it over most deeply  most intently  he had at first hoped to induce
mr <end> woodhouse to remove with her to donwell  he had wanted to believe
it feasible  but his knowledge of mr <end> woodhouse would not suffer
him to deceive himself long  and now he confessed his persuasion 
that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father s comfort 
perhaps even of his life  which must not be hazarded <end>  mr <end> woodhouse
taken from hartfield   no  he felt that it ought not to be attempted <end>
but the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this  he trusted
his dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable 
it was  that he should be received at hartfield  that so long as
her father s happiness in other words his life  required hartfield
to continue her home  it should be his likewise <end>

of their all removing to donwell  emma had already had her own
passing thoughts <end>  like him  she had tried the scheme and rejected it 
but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her <end>
she was sensible of all the affection it evinced <end>  she felt that 
in quitting donwell  he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence
of hours and habits  that in living constantly with her father 
and in no house of his own  there would be much  very much 
to be borne with <end>  she promised to think of it  and advised him
to think of it more  but he was fully convinced  that no reflection
could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject <end>  he had
given it  he could assure her  very long and calm consideration 
he had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning 
to have his thoughts to himself <end>

 ah  there is one difficulty unprovided for   cried emma <end>   i am
sure william larkins will not like it <end>  you must get his consent
before you ask mine <end> 

she promised  however  to think of it  and pretty nearly promised  moreover 
to think of it  with the intention of finding it a very good scheme <end>

it is remarkable  that emma  in the many  very many  points of view
in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey  was never
struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry  whose rights
as heir expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded <end>
think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy 
and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it 
and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent
dislike of mr <end> knightley s marrying jane fairfax  or any body else 
which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of
the sister and the aunt <end>

this proposal of his  this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfield  
the more she contemplated it  the more pleasing it became <end>
his evils seemed to lessen  her own advantages to increase 
their mutual good to outweigh every drawback <end>  such a companion
for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her   
such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be
giving increase of melancholy 

she would have been too happy but for poor harriet  but every
blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings
of her friend  who must now be even excluded from hartfield <end>
the delightful family party which emma was securing for herself 
poor harriet must  in mere charitable caution  be kept at a
distance from <end>  she would be a loser in every way <end>  emma could not
deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment <end>
in such a party  harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise 
but for the poor girl herself  it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity
that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment <end>

in time  of course  mr <end> knightley would be forgotten  that is 
supplanted  but this could not be expected to happen very early <end>
mr <end> knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure   
not like mr <end> elton <end>  mr <end> knightley  always so kind  so feeling 
so truly considerate for every body  would never deserve to be
less worshipped than now  and it really was too much to hope even
of harriet  that she could be in love with more than  three  men
in one year <end>



chapter xvi


it was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous
as herself to avoid a meeting <end>  their intercourse was painful
enough by letter <end>  how much worse  had they been obliged to meet 

harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed 
without reproaches  or apparent sense of ill usage  and yet emma fancied
there was a something of resentment  a something bordering on it in
her style  which increased the desirableness of their being separate <end>  
it might be only her own consciousness  but it seemed as if an
angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke <end>

she had no difficulty in procuring isabella s invitation 
and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it 
without resorting to invention <end>  there was a tooth amiss <end>
harriet really wished  and had wished some time  to consult a dentist <end>
mrs <end> john knightley was delighted to be of use  any thing of ill
health was a recommendation to her  and though not so fond of a
dentist as of a mr <end> wingfield  she was quite eager to have harriet
under her care <end>  when it was thus settled on her sister s side 
emma proposed it to her friend  and found her very persuadable <end>  
harriet was to go  she was invited for at least a fortnight  she was
to be conveyed in mr <end> woodhouse s carriage <end>  it was all arranged 
it was all completed  and harriet was safe in brunswick square <end>

now emma could  indeed  enjoy mr <end> knightley s visits  now she
could talk  and she could listen with true happiness  unchecked by
that sense of injustice  of guilt  of something most painful 
which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was
near her  how much might at that moment  and at a little distance 
be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself <end>

the difference of harriet at mrs <end> goddard s  or in london  made perhaps
an unreasonable difference in emma s sensations  but she could not
think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment 
which must be averting the past  and carrying her out of herself <end>

she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place
in her mind which harriet had occupied <end>  there was a communication
before her  one which  she  only could be competent to make  
the confession of her engagement to her father  but she would
have nothing to do with it at present <end>  she had resolved to defer
the disclosure till mrs <end> weston were safe and well <end>  no additional
agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved  
and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the
appointed time <end>  a fortnight  at least  of leisure and peace of mind 
to crown every warmer  but more agitating  delight  should be hers <end>

she soon resolved  equally as a duty and a pleasure  to employ half
an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax <end>  
she ought to go  and she was longing to see her  the resemblance of
their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill <end>
it would be a  secret  satisfaction  but the consciousness of a
similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with
which she should attend to any thing jane might communicate <end>

she went  she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door  but had
not been into the house since the morning after box hill  when poor
jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion 
though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected <end>  
the fear of being still unwelcome  determined her  though assured
of their being at home  to wait in the passage  and send up her name <end>  
she heard patty announcing it  but no such bustle succeeded as poor
miss bates had before made so happily intelligible <end>  no  she heard
nothing but the instant reply of   beg her to walk up    and a moment
afterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself  coming eagerly
forward  as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient <end>  
emma had never seen her look so well  so lovely  so engaging <end>
there was consciousness  animation  and warmth  there was every
thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted <end>  
she came forward with an offered hand  and said  in a low  but very
feeling tone 

 this is most kind  indeed   miss woodhouse  it is impossible
for me to express  i hope you will believe  excuse me for being
so entirely without words <end> 

emma was gratified  and would soon have shewn no want of words 
if the sound of mrs <end> elton s voice from the sitting room had not
checked her  and made it expedient to compress all her friendly
and all her congratulatory sensations into a very  very earnest
shake of the hand <end>

mrs <end> bates and mrs <end> elton were together <end>  miss bates was out 
which accounted for the previous tranquillity <end>  emma could have
wished mrs <end> elton elsewhere  but she was in a humour to have patience
with every body  and as mrs <end> elton met her with unusual graciousness 
she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm <end>

she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs <end> elton s thoughts 
and understand why she was  like herself  in happy spirits 
it was being in miss fairfax s confidence  and fancying herself
acquainted with what was still a secret to other people <end>
emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face 
and while paying her own compliments to mrs <end> bates  and appearing
to attend to the good old lady s replies  she saw her with a sort
of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently
been reading aloud to miss fairfax  and return it into the purple
and gold reticule by her side  saying  with significant nods 

 we can finish this some other time  you know <end>  you and i shall
not want opportunities <end>  and  in fact  you have heard all the
essential already <end>  i only wanted to prove to you that mrs <end> s <end> admits
our apology  and is not offended <end>  you see how delightfully
she writes <end>  oh  she is a sweet creature   you would have doated
on her  had you gone <end>  but not a word more <end>  let us be discreet  
quite on our good behaviour <end>  hush   you remember those lines  
i forget the poem at this moment 

         for when a lady s in the case 
         you know all other things give place <end> 

now i say  my dear  in  our  case  for  lady   read    mum  a word
to the wise <end>  i am in a fine flow of spirits  an t i   but i want
to set your heart at ease as to mrs <end> s <end>   my  representation  you see 
has quite appeased her <end> 

and again  on emma s merely turning her head to look
at mrs <end> bates s knitting  she added  in a half whisper 

 i mentioned no  names   you will observe <end>  oh  no  cautious as
a minister of state <end>  i managed it extremely well <end> 

emma could not doubt <end>  it was a palpable display  repeated on every
possible occasion <end>  when they had all talked a little while in harmony
of the weather and mrs <end> weston  she found herself abruptly addressed with 

 do not you think  miss woodhouse  our saucy little friend here is
charmingly recovered   do not you think her cure does perry the
highest credit    here was a side glance of great meaning at jane <end> 
upon my word  perry has restored her in a wonderful short time   
oh  if you had seen her  as i did  when she was at the worst    
and when mrs <end> bates was saying something to emma  whispered farther 
 we do not say a word of any  assistance  that perry might have 
not a word of a certain young physician from windsor <end>  oh  no 
perry shall have all the credit <end> 

 i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you  miss woodhouse  
she shortly afterwards began   since the party to box hill <end>
very pleasant party <end>  but yet i think there was something wanting <end>
things did not seem  that is  there seemed a little cloud upon
the spirits of some <end>  so it appeared to me at least  but i might
be mistaken <end>  however  i think it answered so far as to tempt one
to go again <end>  what say you both to our collecting the same party 
and exploring to box hill again  while the fine weather lasts   
it must be the same party  you know  quite the same party 
not  one  exception <end> 

soon after this miss bates came in  and emma could not help being diverted
by the perplexity of her first answer to herself  resulting  she supposed 
from doubt of what might be said  and impatience to say every thing <end>

 thank you  dear miss woodhouse  you are all kindness <end>  it is impossible
to say  yes  indeed  i quite understand  dearest jane s prospects  
that is  i do not mean <end>  but she is charmingly recovered <end>  
how is mr <end> woodhouse   i am so glad <end>  quite out of my power <end>  
such a happy little circle as you find us here <end>  yes  indeed <end>  
charming young man   that is  so very friendly  i mean good mr <end> perry   
such attention to jane    and from her great  her more than commonly
thankful delight towards mrs <end> elton for being there  emma guessed
that there had been a little show of resentment towards jane 
from the vicarage quarter  which was now graciously overcome <end>  
after a few whispers  indeed  which placed it beyond a guess 
mrs <end> elton  speaking louder  said 

 yes  here i am  my good friend  and here i have been so long 
that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise 
but  the truth is  that i am waiting for my lord and master <end>
he promised to join me here  and pay his respects to you <end> 

 what  are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr <end> elton   
that will be a favour indeed  for i know gentlemen do not like
morning visits  and mr <end> elton s time is so engaged <end> 

 upon my word it is  miss bates <end>  he really is engaged from morning
to night <end>  there is no end of people s coming to him  on some pretence
or other <end>  the magistrates  and overseers  and churchwardens 
are always wanting his opinion <end>  they seem not able to do any thing
without him <end>   upon my word  mr <end> e <end>   i often say   rather you than i <end>  
i do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument 
if i had half so many applicants <end>   bad enough as it is  for i
absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree <end>  i believe
i have not played a bar this fortnight <end>  however  he is coming 
i assure you   yes  indeed  on purpose to wait on you all <end>   and putting
up her hand to screen her words from emma   a congratulatory visit 
you know <end>  oh  yes  quite indispensable <end> 

miss bates looked about her  so happily   

 he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself
from knightley  but he and knightley are shut up together
in deep consultation <end>  mr <end> e <end> is knightley s right hand <end> 

emma would not have smiled for the world  and only said   is mr <end> elton
gone on foot to donwell   he will have a hot walk <end> 

 oh  no  it is a meeting at the crown  a regular meeting <end>
weston and cole will be there too  but one is apt to speak only
of those who lead <end>  i fancy mr <end> e <end> and knightley have every thing
their own way <end> 

 have not you mistaken the day   said emma <end>   i am almost certain
that the meeting at the crown is not till to morrow <end>  mr <end> knightley
was at hartfield yesterday  and spoke of it as for saturday <end> 

 oh  no  the meeting is certainly to day   was the abrupt answer 
which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs <end> elton s side <end>  
 i do believe   she continued   this is the most troublesome parish
that ever was <end>  we never heard of such things at maple grove <end> 

 your parish there was small   said jane <end>

 upon my word  my dear  i do not know  for i never heard the subject
talked of <end> 

 but it is proved by the smallness of the school  which i have heard
you speak of  as under the patronage of your sister and mrs <end> bragge 
the only school  and not more than five and twenty children <end> 

 ah  you clever creature  that s very true <end>  what a thinking brain
you have   i say  jane  what a perfect character you and i should make 
if we could be shaken together <end>  my liveliness and your solidity
would produce perfection <end>  not that i presume to insinuate  however 
that  some  people may not think  you  perfection already <end>  but hush   
not a word  if you please <end> 

it seemed an unnecessary caution  jane was wanting to give her words 
not to mrs <end> elton  but to miss woodhouse  as the latter plainly saw <end>
the wish of distinguishing her  as far as civility permitted 
was very evident  though it could not often proceed beyond a look <end>

mr <end> elton made his appearance <end>  his lady greeted him with some
of her sparkling vivacity <end>

 very pretty  sir  upon my word  to send me on here  to be an
encumbrance to my friends  so long before you vouchsafe to come   
but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with <end>
you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared <end>  
here have i been sitting this hour  giving these young ladies
a sample of true conjugal obedience  for who can say  you know 
how soon it may be wanted  

mr <end> elton was so hot and tired  that all this wit seemed thrown away <end>
his civilities to the other ladies must be paid  but his subsequent
object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering 
and the walk he had had for nothing <end>

 when i got to donwell   said he   knightley could not be found <end>
very odd  very unaccountable  after the note i sent him this morning 
and the message he returned  that he should certainly be at home
till one <end> 

 donwell   cried his wife <end>   my dear mr <end> e <end>  you have not been
to donwell   you mean the crown  you come from the meeting at the crown <end> 

 no  no  that s to morrow  and i particularly wanted to see knightley
to day on that very account <end>  such a dreadful broiling morning   
i went over the fields too   speaking in a tone of great ill usage  
which made it so much the worse <end>  and then not to find him at home 
i assure you i am not at all pleased <end>  and no apology left  no message
for me <end>  the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected <end>  
very extraordinary   and nobody knew at all which way he was gone <end>
perhaps to hartfield  perhaps to the abbey mill  perhaps into his woods <end>  
miss woodhouse  this is not like our friend knightley   can you
explain it  

emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary 
indeed  and that she had not a syllable to say for him <end>

 i cannot imagine   said mrs <end> elton   feeling the indignity as a wife
ought to do    i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you 
of all people in the world   the very last person whom one should expect
to be forgotten   my dear mr <end> e <end>  he must have left a message for you 
i am sure he must <end>  not even knightley could be so very eccentric   
and his servants forgot it <end>  depend upon it  that was the case 
and very likely to happen with the donwell servants  who are all 
i have often observed  extremely awkward and remiss <end>  i am sure i
would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard
for any consideration <end>  and as for mrs <end> hodges  wright holds
her very cheap indeed <end>  she promised wright a receipt  and never
sent it <end> 

 i met william larkins   continued mr <end> elton   as i got near
the house  and he told me i should not find his master at home 
but i did not believe him <end>  william seemed rather out of humour <end>
he did not know what was come to his master lately  he said  but he
could hardly ever get the speech of him <end>  i have nothing to do with
william s wants  but it really is of very great importance that  i 
should see knightley to day  and it becomes a matter  therefore 
of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk
to no purpose <end> 

emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly <end>
in all probability she was at this very time waited for there 
and mr <end> knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression
towards mr <end> elton  if not towards william larkins <end>

she was pleased  on taking leave  to find miss fairfax determined
to attend her out of the room  to go with her even downstairs 
it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of 
to say 

 it is as well  perhaps  that i have not had the possibility <end>
had you not been surrounded by other friends  i might have been
tempted to introduce a subject  to ask questions  to speak more
openly than might have been strictly correct <end>  i feel that i should
certainly have been impertinent <end> 

 oh   cried jane  with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought
infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her
usual composure   there would have been no danger <end>  the danger
would have been of my wearying you <end>  you could not have gratified
me more than by expressing an interest   <end>  indeed  miss woodhouse 
 speaking more collectedly   with the consciousness which i
have of misconduct  very great misconduct  it is particularly
consoling to me to know that those of my friends  whose good
opinion is most worth preserving  are not disgusted to such a
degree as to  i have not time for half that i could wish to say <end>
i long to make apologies  excuses  to urge something for myself <end>
i feel it so very due <end>  but  unfortunately  in short  if your
compassion does not stand my friend   

 oh  you are too scrupulous  indeed you are   cried emma warmly 
and taking her hand <end>   you owe me no apologies  and every body to
whom you might be supposed to owe them  is so perfectly satisfied 
so delighted even   

 you are very kind  but i know what my manners were to you <end>  
so cold and artificial   i had always a part to act <end>  it was a life
of deceit   i know that i must have disgusted you <end> 

 pray say no more <end>  i feel that all the apologies should be on my side <end>
let us forgive each other at once <end>  we must do whatever is to be
done quickest  and i think our feelings will lose no time there <end>
i hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor  

 very <end> 

 and the next news  i suppose  will be  that we are to lose you  
just as i begin to know you <end> 

 oh  as to all that  of course nothing can be thought of yet <end>
i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs <end> campbell <end> 

 nothing can be actually settled yet  perhaps   replied emma 
smiling   but  excuse me  it must be thought of <end> 

the smile was returned as jane answered 

 you are very right  it has been thought of <end>  and i will own
to you   i am sure it will be safe   that so far as our living
with mr <end> churchill at enscombe  it is settled <end>  there must be
three months  at least  of deep mourning  but when they are over 
i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for <end> 

 thank you  thank you <end>  this is just what i wanted to be assured of <end>  
oh  if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open   
good bye  good bye <end> 



chapter xvii


mrs <end> weston s friends were all made happy by her safety 
and if the satisfaction of her well doing could be increased
to emma  it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl <end>
she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston <end>  she would
not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match
for her  hereafter  with either of isabella s sons  but she was
convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best <end>
it would be a great comfort to mr <end> weston  as he grew older  
and even mr <end> weston might be growing older ten years hence  to have
his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense  the freaks
and the fancies of a child never banished from home  and mrs <end> weston  
no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her  and it
would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach 
should not have their powers in exercise again <end>

 she has had the advantage  you know  of practising on me  
she continued   like la baronne d almane on la comtesse d ostalis 
in madame de genlis  adelaide and theodore  and we shall now see
her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan <end> 

 that is   replied mr <end> knightley   she will indulge her even more
than she did you  and believe that she does not indulge her at all <end>
it will be the only difference <end> 

 poor child   cried emma   at that rate  what will become of her  

 nothing very bad <end>  the fate of thousands <end>  she will be disagreeable
in infancy  and correct herself as she grows older <end>  i am losing
all my bitterness against spoilt children  my dearest emma <end>
i  who am owing all my happiness to  you   would not it be horrible
ingratitude in me to be severe on them  

emma laughed  and replied    but i had the assistance of all
your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people <end>
i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it <end> 

 do you   i have no doubt <end>  nature gave you understanding   
miss taylor gave you principles <end>  you must have done well <end>
my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good <end>  it was
very natural for you to say  what right has he to lecture me   
and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done
in a disagreeable manner <end>  i do not believe i did you any good <end>
the good was all to myself  by making you an object of the tenderest
affection to me <end>  i could not think about you so much without doating
on you  faults and all  and by dint of fancying so many errors 
have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least <end> 

 i am sure you were of use to me   cried emma <end>   i was very often
influenced rightly by you  oftener than i would own at the time <end>
i am very sure you did me good <end>  and if poor little anna weston is
to be spoiled  it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much
for her as you have done for me  except falling in love with her
when she is thirteen <end> 

 how often  when you were a girl  have you said to me  with one
of your saucy looks   mr <end> knightley  i am going to do so and so 
papa says i may  or i have miss taylor s leave   something which 
you knew  i did not approve <end>  in such cases my interference was giving
you two bad feelings instead of one <end> 

 what an amiable creature i was   no wonder you should hold
my speeches in such affectionate remembrance <end> 

  mr <end> knightley <end>   you always called me   mr <end> knightley   and 
from habit  it has not so very formal a sound <end>  and yet it is formal <end>
i want you to call me something else  but i do not know what <end> 

 i remember once calling you  george   in one of my amiable fits 
about ten years ago <end>  i did it because i thought it would offend you 
but  as you made no objection  i never did it again <end> 

 and cannot you call me  george  now  

 impossible   i never can call you any thing but  mr <end> knightley <end> 
i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs <end> elton 
by calling you mr <end> k <end>  but i will promise   she added presently 
laughing and blushing   i will promise to call you once by your
christian name <end>  i do not say when  but perhaps you may guess
where   in the building in which n <end> takes m <end> for better  for worse <end> 

emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one
important service which his better sense would have rendered her 
to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all
her womanly follies  her wilful intimacy with harriet smith 
but it was too tender a subject <end>  she could not enter on it <end>  
harriet was very seldom mentioned between them <end>  this  on his side 
might merely proceed from her not being thought of  but emma
was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy  and a suspicion 
from some appearances  that their friendship were declining <end>
she was aware herself  that  parting under any other circumstances 
they certainly should have corresponded more  and that her
intelligence would not have rested  as it now almost wholly did 
on isabella s letters <end>  he might observe that it was so <end>  the pain
of being obliged to practise concealment towards him  was very little
inferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy <end>

isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could
be expected  on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits 
which appeared perfectly natural  as there was a dentist to
be consulted  but  since that business had been over  she did not
appear to find harriet different from what she had known her before <end>  
isabella  to be sure  was no very quick observer  yet if harriet
had not been equal to playing with the children  it would not have
escaped her <end>  emma s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on 
by harriet s being to stay longer  her fortnight was likely to be
a month at least <end>  mr <end> and mrs <end> john knightley were to come down
in august  and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back <end>

 john does not even mention your friend   said mr <end> knightley <end>
 here is his answer  if you like to see it <end> 

it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage <end>
emma accepted it with a very eager hand  with an impatience all alive
to know what he would say about it  and not at all checked by hearing
that her friend was unmentioned <end>

 john enters like a brother into my happiness   continued mr <end> knightley 
 but he is no complimenter  and though i well know him to have 
likewise  a most brotherly affection for you  he is so far from
making flourishes  that any other young woman might think him rather
cool in her praise <end>  but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes <end> 

 he writes like a sensible man   replied emma  when she had read
the letter <end>   i honour his sincerity <end>  it is very plain that he
considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side 
but that he is not without hope of my growing  in time  as worthy
of your affection  as you think me already <end>  had he said any thing
to bear a different construction  i should not have believed him <end> 

 my emma  he means no such thing <end>  he only means   

 he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two  
interrupted she  with a sort of serious smile   much less  perhaps 
than he is aware of  if we could enter without ceremony or reserve
on the subject <end> 

 emma  my dear emma   

 oh   she cried with more thorough gaiety   if you fancy your
brother does not do me justice  only wait till my dear father is in
the secret  and hear his opinion <end>  depend upon it  he will be much
farther from doing  you  justice <end>  he will think all the happiness 
all the advantage  on your side of the question  all the merit
on mine <end>  i wish i may not sink into  poor emma  with him at once <end>  
his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther <end> 

 ah   he cried   i wish your father might be half as easily convinced
as john will be  of our having every right that equal worth can give 
to be happy together <end>  i am amused by one part of john s letter  
did you notice it   where he says  that my information did not take
him wholly by surprize  that he was rather in expectation of hearing
something of the kind <end> 

 if i understand your brother  he only means so far as your having
some thoughts of marrying <end>  he had no idea of me <end>  he seems perfectly
unprepared for that <end> 

 yes  yes  but i am amused that he should have seen so far into
my feelings <end>  what has he been judging by   i am not conscious
of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare
him at this time for my marrying any more than at another <end>  
but it was so  i suppose <end>  i dare say there was a difference when i
was staying with them the other day <end>  i believe i did not play
with the children quite so much as usual <end>  i remember one evening
the poor boys saying   uncle seems always tired now <end>  

the time was coming when the news must spread farther  and other persons 
reception of it tried <end>  as soon as mrs <end> weston was sufficiently
recovered to admit mr <end> woodhouse s visits  emma having it in view
that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause 
resolved first to announce it at home  and then at randalls <end>  
but how to break it to her father at last   she had bound herself
to do it  in such an hour of mr <end> knightley s absence  or when it
came to the point her heart would have failed her  and she must
have put it off  but mr <end> knightley was to come at such a time 
and follow up the beginning she was to make <end>  she was forced
to speak  and to speak cheerfully too <end>  she must not make it a more
decided subject of misery to him  by a melancholy tone herself <end>
she must not appear to think it a misfortune <end>  with all the spirits
she could command  she prepared him first for something strange 
and then  in a few words  said  that if his consent and approbation
could be obtained  which  she trusted  would be attended with
no difficulty  since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all  
she and mr <end> knightley meant to marry  by which means hartfield
would receive the constant addition of that person s company
whom she knew he loved  next to his daughters and mrs <end> weston 
best in the world <end>

poor man   it was at first a considerable shock to him  and he tried
earnestly to dissuade her from it <end>  she was reminded  more than once 
of having always said she would never marry  and assured that it
would be a great deal better for her to remain single  and told of
poor isabella  and poor miss taylor <end>  but it would not do <end>  emma hung
about him affectionately  and smiled  and said it must be so  and that
he must not class her with isabella and mrs <end> weston  whose marriages
taking them from hartfield  had  indeed  made a melancholy change 
but she was not going from hartfield  she should be always there 
she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but
for the better  and she was very sure that he would be a great deal
the happier for having mr <end> knightley always at hand  when he were once
got used to the idea <end>  did he not love mr <end> knightley very much   
he would not deny that he did  she was sure <end>  whom did he ever want
to consult on business but mr <end> knightley   who was so useful to him 
who so ready to write his letters  who so glad to assist him   
who so cheerful  so attentive  so attached to him   would not he
like to have him always on the spot   yes <end>  that was all very true <end>
mr <end> knightley could not be there too often  he should be glad to see
him every day   but they did see him every day as it was <end>  why could
not they go on as they had done 

mr <end> woodhouse could not be soon reconciled  but the worst was overcome 
the idea was given  time and continual repetition must do the rest <end>  
to emma s entreaties and assurances succeeded mr <end> knightley s 
whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome 
and he was soon used to be talked to by each  on every fair occasion <end>  
they had all the assistance which isabella could give  by letters
of the strongest approbation  and mrs <end> weston was ready 
on the first meeting  to consider the subject in the most
serviceable light  first  as a settled  and  secondly  as a good one  
well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations
to mr <end> woodhouse s mind <end>  it was agreed upon  as what was to be 
and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that
it would be for his happiness  and having some feelings himself
which almost admitted it  he began to think that some time or other  
in another year or two  perhaps  it might not be so very bad
if the marriage did take place <end>

mrs <end> weston was acting no part  feigning no feelings in all that she
said to him in favour of the event <end>  she had been extremely surprized 
never more so  than when emma first opened the affair to her 
but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all  and had
no scruple in urging him to the utmost <end>  she had such a regard
for mr <end> knightley  as to think he deserved even her dearest emma 
and it was in every respect so proper  suitable  and unexceptionable
a connexion  and in one respect  one point of the highest importance 
so peculiarly eligible  so singularly fortunate  that now it seemed
as if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature 
and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having
thought of it  and wished it long ago <end>  how very few of those men
in a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own
home for hartfield   and who but mr <end> knightley could know and bear
with mr <end> woodhouse  so as to make such an arrangement desirable   
the difficulty of disposing of poor mr <end> woodhouse had been always
felt in her husband s plans and her own  for a marriage between frank
and emma <end>  how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had
been a continual impediment  less acknowledged by mr <end> weston than
by herself  but even he had never been able to finish the subject
better than by saying   those matters will take care of themselves 
the young people will find a way <end>   but here there was nothing to be
shifted off in a wild speculation on the future <end>  it was all right 
all open  all equal <end>  no sacrifice on any side worth the name <end>
it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself 
and without one real  rational difficulty to oppose or delay it <end>

mrs <end> weston  with her baby on her knee  indulging in such reflections
as these  was one of the happiest women in the world <end>  if any thing
could increase her delight  it was perceiving that the baby would
soon have outgrown its first set of caps <end>

the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread 
and mr <end> weston had his five minutes share of it  but five minutes
were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind <end>  
he saw the advantages of the match  and rejoiced in them with all
the constancy of his wife  but the wonder of it was very soon nothing 
and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he
had always foreseen it <end>

 it is to be a secret  i conclude   said he <end>   these matters are
always a secret  till it is found out that every body knows them <end>
only let me be told when i may speak out <end>  i wonder whether jane has
any suspicion <end> 

he went to highbury the next morning  and satisfied himself on
that point <end>  he told her the news <end>  was not she like a daughter 
his eldest daughter   he must tell her  and miss bates being present 
it passed  of course  to mrs <end> cole  mrs <end> perry  and mrs <end> elton 
immediately afterwards <end>  it was no more than the principals were
prepared for  they had calculated from the time of its being known
at randalls  how soon it would be over highbury  and were thinking
of themselves  as the evening wonder in many a family circle 
with great sagacity <end>

in general  it was a very well approved match <end>  some might think him 
and others might think her  the most in luck <end>  one set might
recommend their all removing to donwell  and leaving hartfield
for the john knightleys  and another might predict disagreements
among their servants  but yet  upon the whole  there was no serious
objection raised  except in one habitation  the vicarage <end>  there 
the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction <end>  mr <end> elton
cared little about it  compared with his wife  he only hoped  the
young lady s pride would now be contented   and supposed  she had
always meant to catch knightley if she could   and  on the point
of living at hartfield  could daringly exclaim   rather he than i    
but mrs <end> elton was very much discomposed indeed <end>   poor knightley 
poor fellow   sad business for him <end>  she was extremely concerned 
for  though very eccentric  he had a thousand good qualities <end>  
how could he be so taken in   did not think him at all in love  
not in the least <end>  poor knightley   there would be an end of all
pleasant intercourse with him <end>  how happy he had been to come and dine
with them whenever they asked him   but that would be all over now <end>  
poor fellow   no more exploring parties to donwell made for  her  <end>
oh  no  there would be a mrs <end> knightley to throw cold water on
every thing <end>  extremely disagreeable   but she was not at all sorry
that she had abused the housekeeper the other day <end>  shocking plan 
living together <end>  it would never do <end>  she knew a family near maple
grove who had tried it  and been obliged to separate before the end
of the first quarter <end>



chapter xviii


time passed on <end>  a few more to morrows  and the party from london
would be arriving <end>  it was an alarming change  and emma was thinking
of it one morning  as what must bring a great deal to agitate and
grieve her  when mr <end> knightley came in  and distressing thoughts
were put by <end>  after the first chat of pleasure he was silent 
and then  in a graver tone  began with 

 i have something to tell you  emma  some news <end> 

 good or bad   said she  quickly  looking up in his face <end>

 i do not know which it ought to be called <end> 

 oh  good i am sure <end>  i see it in your countenance <end>  you are trying
not to smile <end> 

 i am afraid   said he  composing his features   i am very much afraid 
my dear emma  that you will not smile when you hear it <end> 

 indeed  but why so   i can hardly imagine that any thing which
pleases or amuses you  should not please and amuse me too <end> 

 there is one subject   he replied   i hope but one  on which
we do not think alike <end>   he paused a moment  again smiling 
with his eyes fixed on her face <end>   does nothing occur to you   
do not you recollect   harriet smith <end> 

her cheeks flushed at the name  and she felt afraid of something 
though she knew not what <end>

 have you heard from her yourself this morning   cried he <end>
 you have  i believe  and know the whole <end> 

 no  i have not  i know nothing  pray tell me <end> 

 you are prepared for the worst  i see  and very bad it is <end>
harriet smith marries robert martin <end> 

emma gave a start  which did not seem like being prepared  
and her eyes  in eager gaze  said   no  this is impossible  
but her lips were closed <end>

 it is so  indeed   continued mr <end> knightley   i have it from robert
martin himself <end>  he left me not half an hour ago <end> 

she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement <end>

 you like it  my emma  as little as i feared <end>  i wish our opinions were
the same <end>  but in time they will <end>  time  you may be sure  will make
one or the other of us think differently  and  in the meanwhile 
we need not talk much on the subject <end> 

 you mistake me  you quite mistake me   she replied  exerting herself <end>
 it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy 
but i cannot believe it <end>  it seems an impossibility   you cannot mean
to say  that harriet smith has accepted robert martin <end>  you cannot
mean that he has even proposed to her again  yet <end>  you only mean 
that he intends it <end> 

 i mean that he has done it   answered mr <end> knightley  with smiling
but determined decision   and been accepted <end> 

 good god   she cried <end>   well    then having recourse to her workbasket 
in excuse for leaning down her face  and concealing all the
exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she
must be expressing  she added   well  now tell me every thing 
make this intelligible to me <end>  how  where  when   let me know it all <end>
i never was more surprized  but it does not make me unhappy 
i assure you <end>  how  how has it been possible  

 it is a very simple story <end>  he went to town on business three days ago 
and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting
to send to john <end>  he delivered these papers to john  at his chambers 
and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley s <end>
they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley s <end> the party
was to be our brother and sister  henry  john  and miss smith <end>
my friend robert could not resist <end>  they called for him in their way 
were all extremely amused  and my brother asked him to dine with
them the next day  which he did  and in the course of that visit
 as i understand  he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet 
and certainly did not speak in vain <end>  she made him  by her acceptance 
as happy even as he is deserving <end>  he came down by yesterday s coach 
and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast  to report
his proceedings  first on my affairs  and then on his own <end>
this is all that i can relate of the how  where  and when <end>
your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her <end>  
she will give you all the minute particulars  which only woman s
language can make interesting <end>  in our communications we deal only
in the great <end>  however  i must say  that robert martin s heart seemed
for  him   and to  me   very overflowing  and that he did mention 
without its being much to the purpose  that on quitting their
box at astley s  my brother took charge of mrs <end> john knightley
and little john  and he followed with miss smith and henry 
and that at one time they were in such a crowd  as to make miss smith
rather uneasy <end> 

he stopped <end>  emma dared not attempt any immediate reply <end>  to speak 
she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree
of happiness <end>  she must wait a moment  or he would think her mad <end>
her silence disturbed him  and after observing her a little while 
he added 

 emma  my love  you said that this circumstance would not now make
you unhappy  but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected <end>
his situation is an evil  but you must consider it as what satisfies
your friend  and i will answer for your thinking better and better
of him as you know him more <end>  his good sense and good principles would
delight you <end>  as far as the man is concerned  you could not wish your
friend in better hands <end>  his rank in society i would alter if i could 
which is saying a great deal i assure you  emma <end>  you laugh at me
about william larkins  but i could quite as ill spare robert martin <end> 

he wanted her to look up and smile  and having now brought herself
not to smile too broadly  she did  cheerfully answering 

 you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match <end>  i think
harriet is doing extremely well <end>   her  connexions may be worse than  his  <end>
in respectability of character  there can be no doubt that they are <end>
i have been silent from surprize merely  excessive surprize <end>
you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me  how peculiarly
unprepared i was   for i had reason to believe her very lately more
determined against him  much more  than she was before <end> 

 you ought to know your friend best   replied mr <end> knightley 
 but i should say she was a good tempered  soft hearted girl 
not likely to be very  very determined against any young man who told
her he loved her <end> 

emma could not help laughing as she answered   upon my word 
i believe you know her quite as well as i do <end>  but  mr <end> knightley 
are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright
 accepted  him <end>  i could suppose she might in time  but can she already   
did not you misunderstand him   you were both talking of other things 
of business  shows of cattle  or new drills  and might not you 
in the confusion of so many subjects  mistake him   it was not
harriet s hand that he was certain of  it was the dimensions of some
famous ox <end> 

the contrast between the countenance and air of mr <end> knightley and
robert martin was  at this moment  so strong to emma s feelings 
and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently
passed on harriet s side  so fresh the sound of those words 
spoken with such emphasis   no  i hope i know better than to think
of robert martin   that she was really expecting the intelligence
to prove  in some measure  premature <end>  it could not be otherwise <end>

 do you dare say this   cried mr <end> knightley <end>   do you dare to suppose
me so great a blockhead  as not to know what a man is talking of   
what do you deserve  

 oh   i always deserve the best treatment  because i never put
up with any other  and  therefore  you must give me a plain 
direct answer <end>  are you quite sure that you understand the terms
on which mr <end> martin and harriet now are  

 i am quite sure   he replied  speaking very distinctly   that he
told me she had accepted him  and that there was no obscurity 
nothing doubtful  in the words he used  and i think i can give you
a proof that it must be so <end>  he asked my opinion as to what he
was now to do <end>  he knew of no one but mrs <end> goddard to whom he
could apply for information of her relations or friends <end>  could i
mention any thing more fit to be done  than to go to mrs <end> goddard 
i assured him that i could not <end>  then  he said  he would endeavour
to see her in the course of this day <end> 

 i am perfectly satisfied   replied emma  with the brightest smiles 
 and most sincerely wish them happy <end> 

 you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before <end> 

 i hope so  for at that time i was a fool <end> 

 and i am changed also  for i am now very willing to grant you all
harriet s good qualities <end>  i have taken some pains for your sake 
and for robert martin s sake   whom i have always had reason to believe
as much in love with her as ever   to get acquainted with her <end>
i have often talked to her a good deal <end>  you must have seen that
i did <end>  sometimes  indeed  i have thought you were half suspecting me
of pleading poor martin s cause  which was never the case  but  from all
my observations  i am convinced of her being an artless  amiable girl 
with very good notions  very seriously good principles  and placing
her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life <end>  
much of this  i have no doubt  she may thank you for <end> 

 me   cried emma  shaking her head <end>   ah  poor harriet  

she checked herself  however  and submitted quietly to a little
more praise than she deserved <end>

their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of
her father <end>  she was not sorry <end>  she wanted to be alone <end>  her mind
was in a state of flutter and wonder  which made it impossible for her
to be collected <end>  she was in dancing  singing  exclaiming spirits 
and till she had moved about  and talked to herself  and laughed
and reflected  she could be fit for nothing rational <end>

her father s business was to announce james s being gone out to put
the horses to  preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls 
and she had  therefore  an immediate excuse for disappearing <end>

the joy  the gratitude  the exquisite delight of her sensations
may be imagined <end>  the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the
prospect of harriet s welfare  she was really in danger of becoming
too happy for security <end>  what had she to wish for   nothing  but to
grow more worthy of him  whose intentions and judgment had been
ever so superior to her own <end>  nothing  but that the lessons
of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future <end>

serious she was  very serious in her thankfulness  and in her resolutions 
and yet there was no preventing a laugh  sometimes in the very midst
of them <end>  she must laugh at such a close   such an end of the doleful
disappointment of five weeks back   such a heart  such a harriet 

now there would be pleasure in her returning  every thing would
be a pleasure <end>  it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin <end>

high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities 
was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from
mr <end> knightley would soon be over <end>  the disguise  equivocation 
mystery  so hateful to her to practise  might soon be over <end>
she could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect
confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty <end>

in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father 
not always listening  but always agreeing to what he said 
and  whether in speech or silence  conniving at the comfortable
persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day 
or poor mrs <end> weston would be disappointed <end>

they arrived <end>  mrs <end> weston was alone in the drawing room   
but hardly had they been told of the baby  and mr <end> woodhouse
received the thanks for coming  which he asked for  when a glimpse
was caught through the blind  of two figures passing near the window <end>

 it is frank and miss fairfax   said mrs <end> weston <end>   i was just
going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive
this morning <end>  he stays till to morrow  and miss fairfax has been
persuaded to spend the day with us <end>  they are coming in  i hope <end> 

in half a minute they were in the room <end>  emma was extremely glad
to see him  but there was a degree of confusion  a number of
embarrassing recollections on each side <end>  they met readily and smiling 
but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said 
and having all sat down again  there was for some time such a blank
in the circle  that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged 
which she had long felt  of seeing frank churchill once more 
and of seeing him with jane  would yield its proportion of pleasure <end>
when mr <end> weston joined the party  however  and when the baby
was fetched  there was no longer a want of subject or animation  
or of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her
and say 

 i have to thank you  miss woodhouse  for a very kind forgiving
message in one of mrs <end> weston s letters <end>  i hope time has not made
you less willing to pardon <end>  i hope you do not retract what you
then said <end> 

 no  indeed   cried emma  most happy to begin   not in the least <end>
i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you  and to give
you joy in person <end> 

he thanked her with all his heart  and continued some time to speak
with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness <end>

 is not she looking well   said he  turning his eyes towards jane <end>
 better than she ever used to do   you see how my father and
mrs <end> weston doat upon her <end> 

but his spirits were soon rising again  and with laughing eyes 
after mentioning the expected return of the campbells  he named
the name of dixon <end>  emma blushed  and forbade its being pronounced
in her hearing <end>

 i can never think of it   she cried   without extreme shame <end> 

 the shame   he answered   is all mine  or ought to be <end>  but is it
possible that you had no suspicion   i mean of late <end>  early  i know 
you had none <end> 

 i never had the smallest  i assure you <end> 

 that appears quite wonderful <end>  i was once very near  and i wish i had  
it would have been better <end>  but though i was always doing wrong things 
they were very bad wrong things  and such as did me no service <end>  
it would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond
of secrecy and told you every thing <end> 

 it is not now worth a regret   said emma <end>

 i have some hope   resumed he   of my uncle s being persuaded
to pay a visit at randalls  he wants to be introduced to her <end>
when the campbells are returned  we shall meet them in london 
and continue there  i trust  till we may carry her northward <end>  but now 
i am at such a distance from her  is not it hard  miss woodhouse   
till this morning  we have not once met since the day of reconciliation <end>
do not you pity me  

emma spoke her pity so very kindly  that with a sudden accession
of gay thought  he cried 

 ah  by the bye   then sinking his voice  and looking demure for
the moment   i hope mr <end> knightley is well    he paused <end>  she coloured
and laughed <end>   i know you saw my letter  and think you may remember
my wish in your favour <end>  let me return your congratulations <end>  
i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest
and satisfaction <end>  he is a man whom i cannot presume to praise <end> 

emma was delighted  and only wanted him to go on in the same style 
but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his
own jane  and his next words were 

 did you ever see such a skin   such smoothness  such delicacy   
and yet without being actually fair <end>  one cannot call her fair <end>
it is a most uncommon complexion  with her dark eye lashes and hair  
a most distinguishing complexion   so peculiarly the lady in it <end>  
just colour enough for beauty <end> 

 i have always admired her complexion   replied emma  archly   but do not
i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale   
when we first began to talk of her <end>  have you quite forgotten  

 oh  no  what an impudent dog i was   how could i dare   

but he laughed so heartily at the recollection  that emma could
not help saying 

 i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time 
you had very great amusement in tricking us all <end>  i am sure you had <end>  
i am sure it was a consolation to you <end> 

 oh  no  no  no  how can you suspect me of such a thing 
i was the most miserable wretch  

 not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth <end>  i am sure it
was a source of high entertainment to you  to feel that you were taking
us all in <end>  perhaps i am the readier to suspect  because  to tell
you the truth  i think it might have been some amusement to myself
in the same situation <end>  i think there is a little likeness between us <end> 

he bowed <end>

 if not in our dispositions   she presently added  with a look of
true sensibility   there is a likeness in our destiny  the destiny
which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior
to our own <end> 

 true  true   he answered  warmly <end>   no  not true on your side <end>  you can
have no superior  but most true on mine <end>  she is a complete angel <end>
look at her <end>  is not she an angel in every gesture   observe the turn
of her throat <end>  observe her eyes  as she is looking up at my father <end>  
you will be glad to hear  inclining his head  and whispering seriously 
that my uncle means to give her all my aunt s jewels <end>  they are to be
new set <end>  i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head <end>
will not it be beautiful in her dark hair  

 very beautiful  indeed   replied emma  and she spoke so kindly 
that he gratefully burst out 

 how delighted i am to see you again  and to see you in such
excellent looks   i would not have missed this meeting for the world <end>
i should certainly have called at hartfield  had you failed to come <end> 

the others had been talking of the child  mrs <end> weston giving an
account of a little alarm she had been under  the evening before 
from the infant s appearing not quite well <end>  she believed she had
been foolish  but it had alarmed her  and she had been within half
a minute of sending for mr <end> perry <end>  perhaps she ought to be ashamed 
but mr <end> weston had been almost as uneasy as herself <end>  in ten minutes 
however  the child had been perfectly well again <end>  this was
her history  and particularly interesting it was to mr <end> woodhouse 
who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry 
and only regretted that she had not done it <end>   she should always send
for perry  if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered 
were it only for a moment <end>  she could not be too soon alarmed 
nor send for perry too often <end>  it was a pity  perhaps  that he
had not come last night  for  though the child seemed well now 
very well considering  it would probably have been better if perry
had seen it <end> 

frank churchill caught the name <end>

 perry   said he to emma  and trying  as he spoke  to catch miss
fairfax s eye <end>   my friend mr <end> perry   what are they saying
about mr <end> perry   has he been here this morning   and how does
he travel now   has he set up his carriage  

emma soon recollected  and understood him  and while she joined
in the laugh  it was evident from jane s countenance that she
too was really hearing him  though trying to seem deaf <end>

 such an extraordinary dream of mine   he cried <end>   i can never think
of it without laughing <end>  she hears us  she hears us  miss woodhouse <end>
i see it in her cheek  her smile  her vain attempt to frown <end>
look at her <end>  do not you see that  at this instant  the very passage
of her own letter  which sent me the report  is passing under her eye  
that the whole blunder is spread before her  that she can attend to
nothing else  though pretending to listen to the others  

jane was forced to smile completely  for a moment  and the smile
partly remained as she turned towards him  and said in a conscious 
low  yet steady voice 

 how you can bear such recollections  is astonishing to me   
they  will  sometimes obtrude  but how you can court them  

he had a great deal to say in return  and very entertainingly 
but emma s feelings were chiefly with jane  in the argument  and on
leaving randalls  and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men 
she felt  that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill 
and really regarding him as she did with friendship  she had never
been more sensible of mr <end> knightley s high superiority of character <end>
the happiness of this most happy day  received its completion  in the
animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced <end>



chapter xix


if emma had still  at intervals  an anxious feeling for harriet 
a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured
of her attachment to mr <end> knightley  and really able to accept
another man from unbiased inclination  it was not long that she
had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty <end>
a very few days brought the party from london  and she had no
sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet 
than she became perfectly satisfied  unaccountable as it was   
that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr <end> knightley 
and was now forming all her views of happiness <end>

harriet was a little distressed  did look a little foolish at first 
but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly 
and self deceived  before  her pain and confusion seemed to die
away with the words  and leave her without a care for the past 
and with the fullest exultation in the present and future  for  as to
her friend s approbation  emma had instantly removed every fear of
that nature  by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations <end>  
harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at
astley s  and the dinner the next day  she could dwell on it all
with the utmost delight <end>  but what did such particulars explain   
the fact was  as emma could now acknowledge  that harriet had
always liked robert martin  and that his continuing to love her had
been irresistible <end>  beyond this  it must ever be unintelligible
to emma <end>

the event  however  was most joyful  and every day was giving her
fresh reason for thinking so <end>  harriet s parentage became known <end>
she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman  rich enough to afford
her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers  and decent
enough to have always wished for concealment <end>  such was the blood
of gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for   
it was likely to be as untainted  perhaps  as the blood of many
a gentleman   but what a connexion had she been preparing for
mr <end> knightley  or for the churchills  or even for mr <end> elton   
the stain of illegitimacy  unbleached by nobility or wealth 
would have been a stain indeed <end>

no objection was raised on the father s side  the young man was
treated liberally  it was all as it should be   and as emma became
acquainted with robert martin  who was now introduced at hartfield 
she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth
which could bid fairest for her little friend <end>  she had no doubt
of harriet s happiness with any good tempered man  but with him 
and in the home he offered  there would be the hope of more 
of security  stability  and improvement <end>  she would be placed in the
midst of those who loved her  and who had better sense than herself 
retired enough for safety  and occupied enough for cheerfulness <end>
she would be never led into temptation  nor left for it to find her out <end>
she would be respectable and happy  and emma admitted her to be
the luckiest creature in the world  to have created so steady and
persevering an affection in such a man   or  if not quite the luckiest 
to yield only to herself <end>

harriet  necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins 
was less and less at hartfield  which was not to be regretted <end>  
the intimacy between her and emma must sink  their friendship must
change into a calmer sort of goodwill  and  fortunately  what ought
to be  and must be  seemed already beginning  and in the most gradual 
natural manner <end>

before the end of september  emma attended harriet to church  and saw
her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction 
as no remembrances  even connected with mr <end> elton as he stood
before them  could impair <end>  perhaps  indeed  at that time she
scarcely saw mr <end> elton  but as the clergyman whose blessing at the
altar might next fall on herself <end>  robert martin and harriet smith 
the latest couple engaged of the three  were the first to be married <end>

jane fairfax had already quitted highbury  and was restored to the
comforts of her beloved home with the campbells <end>  the mr <end> churchills
were also in town  and they were only waiting for november <end>

the intermediate month was the one fixed on  as far as they dared 
by emma and mr <end> knightley <end>  they had determined that their marriage
ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield 
to allow them the fortnight s absence in a tour to the seaside 
which was the plan <end>  john and isabella  and every other friend 
were agreed in approving it <end>  but mr <end> woodhouse  how was mr <end> woodhouse
to be induced to consent   he  who had never yet alluded to their
marriage but as a distant event <end>

when first sounded on the subject  he was so miserable  that they
were almost hopeless <end>  a second allusion  indeed  gave less pain <end>  
he began to think it was to be  and that he could not prevent it  
a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation <end>
still  however  he was not happy <end>  nay  he appeared so much otherwise 
that his daughter s courage failed <end>  she could not bear to see
him suffering  to know him fancying himself neglected  and though
her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the
mr <end> knightleys  that when once the event were over  his distress
would be soon over too  she hesitated  she could not proceed <end>

in this state of suspense they were befriended  not by any sudden
illumination of mr <end> woodhouse s mind  or any wonderful change of his
nervous system  but by the operation of the same system in another way <end>  
mrs <end> weston s poultry house was robbed one night of all her turkeys  
evidently by the ingenuity of man <end>  other poultry yards in the
neighbourhood also suffered <end>  pilfering was  housebreaking  to
mr <end> woodhouse s fears <end>  he was very uneasy  and but for the sense
of his son in law s protection  would have been under wretched alarm
every night of his life <end>  the strength  resolution  and presence
of mind of the mr <end> knightleys  commanded his fullest dependence <end>
while either of them protected him and his  hartfield was safe <end>  
but mr <end> john knightley must be in london again by the end of the
first week in november <end>

the result of this distress was  that  with a much more voluntary 
cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at
the moment  she was able to fix her wedding day  and mr <end> elton was
called on  within a month from the marriage of mr <end> and mrs <end> robert
martin  to join the hands of mr <end> knightley and miss woodhouse <end>

the wedding was very much like other weddings  where the parties
have no taste for finery or parade  and mrs <end> elton  from the
particulars detailed by her husband  thought it all extremely shabby 
and very inferior to her own <end>   very little white satin  very few
lace veils  a most pitiful business   selina would stare when she
heard of it <end>   but  in spite of these deficiencies  the wishes 
the hopes  the confidence  the predictions of the small band
of true friends who witnessed the ceremony  were fully answered
in the perfect happiness of the union <end>
