 * HISTORY
 * 
 * 13-Jul-98	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added spf and adbufsize to cont_ad_t in order to support variable
 * 		frame sizes depending on audio sampling rate.
 * 
 * 30-Jun-98	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added FILE* argument to cont_ad_powhist_dump().
 * 
 * 16-Jan-98	Paul Placeway (pwp@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Changed to use dB instead of the weird power measure.
 * 		Added most system parameters to cont_ad_t instead of hardwiring
 * 		them in cont_ad.c.
 * 		Added cont_ad_set_params() and cont_ad_get_params().
 * 
 * 28-Jul-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added cont_ad_t.siglvl.
 * 
 * 27-Jun-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added the option for cont_ad_read to return -1 on EOF.
 * 
 * 21-Jun-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added cont_ad_set_thresh().
 * 
 * 20-Jun-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Separated thresholds for speech and silence.
 * 
 * 17-Jun-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Created, based loosely on Steve Reed's original implementation.

/**

 * \brief Continuous A/D listening and silence filtering module.
 *
 * This module is intended to be interposed as a filter between any raw A/D source and the
 * application to remove silence regions.  Its main purpose is to remove regions of
 * silence from the raw input speech.  It is initialized with a raw A/D source function
 * (during the cont_ad_init call).  The application is responsible for setting up the A/D
 * source, turning recording on and off as it desires.  Filtered A/D data can be read by
 * the application using the cont_ad_read function.
 * 
 * In other words, the application calls cont_ad_read instead of the raw A/D source function
 * (e.g., ad_read in libad) to obtain filtered A/D data with silence regions removed.  This
 * module itself does not enforce any other structural changes to the application.
 * 
 * The cont_ad_read function also updates an "absolute" timestamp (see cont_ad_t.read_ts) at
 * the end of each invocation.  The timestamp indicates the total #samples of A/D data read
 * until this point, including data discarded as silence frames.  The application is
 * responsible for using this timestamp to make any policy decisions regarding utterance
 * boundaries or whatever.
