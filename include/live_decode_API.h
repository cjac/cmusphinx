 *    Created by Yitao Sun (yitao@cs.cmu.edu) based on the live.h created by
 *    Rita Singh.  The Live Decode API is the new top level API for Sphinx3.
 *    The goal of the Live Decode API is to provide a well documented and
 *    comprehensive API to control all aspects of the Sphinx3 speech decoder
 *    engine.
 *
 *    The return values, for example, hypothesis segments and string, unlike
 *    the rest of Sphinx3, are read-only, maintained internally, and clobbered
 *    by subsequent calls.

  ----------------------------
  revision 1.7
  date: 2004/08/27 05:22:43;  author: yitao;  state: Exp;  lines: +75 -105


  removed remote-decode API from the linux compile.  added doc++ comments for live_decod
  e.h-
  ----------------------------
  revision 1.6
  date: 2004/08/25 20:44:31;  author: yitao;  state: Exp;  lines: +13 -15


  1.  added code to record uttid in live-decode
  2.  added more code to flesh out remote-decode.  not compiling yet.
  ----------------------------
  revision 1.5
  date: 2004/08/23 20:41:38;  author: yitao;  state: Exp;  lines: +1 -11

  basic implementation for remote-decode API.  not compiling yet.

  ----------------------------
  revision 1.3
  date: 2004/08/09 21:40:36;  author: yitao;  state: Exp;  lines: +11 -20

  1.  fixed some bugs in Live-Decode API.  changed kb.c, kb.h, utt.c, live_decode.c, liv
  e_decode.h.
  2.  changed some filenames in src/programs/.  now there are 2 sets of livedecode and l
  ivepretend: one that uses the old API (livedecode and livepretend), and one that uses 
  the new API (livedecode2 and livepretend2).
  3.  modified Makefile.am to reflect the filename changes above.
