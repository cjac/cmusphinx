 * HISTORY
 * 
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2006/04/05  20:27:30  dhdfu
 * A Great Reorganzation of header files and executables
 * 
 * Revision 1.2  2006/02/23 05:10:18  arthchan2003
 * Merged from branch SPHINX3_5_2_RCI_IRII_BRANCH: Adaptation of Sphinx 2's FSG search into Sphinx 3
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.5  2005/07/24 19:34:46  arthchan2003
 * Removed search_hyp_t, used srch_hyp_t instead
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.4  2005/07/24 01:34:54  arthchan2003
 * Mode 2 is basically running. Still need to fix function such as resulting and build the correct utterance ID
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.3  2005/07/13 18:39:47  arthchan2003
 * (For Fun) Remove the hmm_t hack. Consider each s2 global functions one-by-one and replace them by sphinx 3's macro.  There are 8 minor HACKs where functions need to be removed temporarily.  Also, there are three major hacks. 1,  there are no concept of "phone" in sphinx3 dict_t, there is only ciphone. That is to say we need to build it ourselves. 2, sphinx2 dict_t will be a bunch of left and right context tables.  This is currently bypass. 3, the fsg routine is using fsg_hmm_t which is just a duplication of CHAN_T in sphinx2, I will guess using hmm_evaluate should be a good replacement.  But I haven't figure it out yet.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.2  2005/06/28 07:01:20  arthchan2003
 * General fix of fsg routines to make a prototype of fsg_init and fsg_read. Not completed.  The number of empty functions in fsg_search is now decreased from 35 to 30.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.1  2005/06/27 05:26:29  arthchan2003
 * Sphinx 2 fsg mainpulation routines.  Compiled with faked functions.  Currently fended off from users.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/07/16 00:57:12  egouvea
 * Added Ravi's implementation of FSG support.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2004/07/07 22:30:35  rkm
 * *** empty log message ***
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2004/07/07 13:56:33  rkm
 * Added reporting of (acoustic score - best senone score)/frame
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2004/06/25 14:49:08  rkm
 * Optimized size of history table and speed of word transitions by maintaining only best scoring word exits at each state
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2004/06/23 20:32:16  rkm

/*
 * The entire tree of history entries (fsg_history_t.entries).
 * Optimization: In a given frame, there may be several history entries, with
 * the same left and right phonetic context, terminating in a particular state.
 * Only the best scoring one of these needs to be saved, since everything else
 * will be pruned according to the Viterbi algorithm.  frame_entries is used
 * temporarily in each frame to determine these best scoring entries in that
 * frame.  Only the ones not pruned are transferred to entries at the end of
 * the frame.  However, null transitions are a problem since they create
 * entries that depend on entries created in the CURRENT frame.  Hence, this
 * pruning is done in two stages: first for the non-null transitions, and then
 * for the null transitions alone.  (This solution is sub-optimal, and can be
 * improved with a little more work.  SMOP.)
 * Why is frame_entries a list?  Each entry has a unique terminating state,
 * and has a unique lc CIphone.  But it has a SET of rc CIphones.
 * frame_entries[s][lc] is an ordered list of entries created in the current
 * frame, terminating in state s, and with left context lc.  The list is in
 * descending order of path score.  When a new entry with (s,lc) arrives,
 * its position in the list is determined.  Then its rc set is modified by
 * subtracting the union of the rc's of all its predecessors (i.e., better
 * scoring entries).  If the resulting rc set is empty, the entry is discarded.
 * Otherwise, it is inserted, and the rc sets of all downstream entries in the
 * list are updated by subtracting the new entry's rc.  If any of them becomes
 * empty, it is also discarded.
 * As mentioned earlier, this procedure is applied in two stages, for the
 * non-null transitions, and the null transitions, separately.
