 * HISTORY
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2006/04/05  20:27:30  dhdfu
 * A Great Reorganzation of header files and executables
 * 
 * Revision 1.11  2006/03/03 19:45:01  egouvea
 * Clean up the log handling. In logs3.c, removed unnecessary variables
 * (e.g. "f", exactly the same as "F") and functions (e.g. "logs3_10base()").
 *
 * In confidence.c, replace (logs3_to_log10(r_lscr) * logs3_10base())
 * with r_lscr, since the only difference is that one is a double, the
 * other an int (and as such, they differ on the order of 1e-12).
 *
 * In future cleanups.... replace the "int" declaration with "int32",
 * used in the rest of the code.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2006/02/22 20:31:53  arthchan2003
 * Add clarification comment on logs3.h
 *
 * Revision 1.9.4.1  2006/01/16 19:51:19  arthchan2003
 * Added a function to convert Sphinx 3 log to log 10.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2005/06/21 20:46:54  arthchan2003
 * 1, Added a report flag in logs3_init, 2, Fixed doxygen documentation, 3, Add the $ keyword.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2005/06/13 04:02:57  archan
 * Fixed most doxygen-style documentation under libs3decoder.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2005/05/27 01:15:44  archan
 * 1, Changing the function prototypes of logs3_init to have another argument which specify whether an add table should be used. Corresponding changes have made in all executables and test programs. 2, Synchronzie how align, allphone, decode_anytopo, dag sets the default value of logbase.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2005/04/21 23:50:26  archan
 * Some more refactoring on the how reporting of structures inside kbcore_t is done, it is now 50% nice. Also added class-based LM test case into test-decode.sh.in.  At this moment, everything in search mode 5 is already done.  It is time to test the idea whether the search can really be used.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2005/03/30 01:22:47  archan
 * Fixed mistakes in last updates. Add
 *
 * 
 * 28-Apr-1999	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
 * 		Added log_to_logs3_factor(), and logs3_to_p().
 * 
 * 05-Nov-95	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
 * 		Created.

/** \file logs3.h
 * \brief s3 log table implementation. 
 *
 * In evaluating HMM models, probability values are often kept in log domain,
 * to avoid overflow.  Furthermore, to enable these logprob values to be held
 * in int32 variables without significant loss of precision, a logbase of
 * (1+epsilon), epsilon<<1, is used.  This module maintains this logbase, and
 * other functions to support it.
