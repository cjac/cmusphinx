 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2006/04/05  20:27:30  dhdfu
 * A Great Reorganzation of header files and executables
 * 
 * Revision 1.2  2006/02/23 05:07:53  arthchan2003
 * Merged from branch SPHINX3_5_2_RCI_IRII_BRANCH: split whmm's routine.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.4  2005/09/07 23:40:06  arthchan2003
 * Several Bug Fixes and Enhancements to the flat-lexicon
 * 1, Fixed Dox-doc.
 * 2, Add -worddumpef and -hmmdumpef in parrallel to -worddumpsf and
 * -hmmdumpsf. Usage is trivial. a structure called fwd_dbg_t now wrapped
 * up all these loose parameters.  Methods of fwd_dbg are implemented.
 * 3, word_ugprob is now initialized by init_word_ugprob
 * 4, Full-triphone expansion is implemented. User can change this
 * behavior by specifying -multiplex_multi and -multiplex_single. The
 * former turn on multiplex triphone for word-begin for multi-phone word.
 * The latter do that for single-phone word. Turning off both could
 * tremendously increase computation.
 * 5, Word expansions of possible right contexts now records independent
 * history.  The behavior in the past was to use only one history for a
 * word.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.3  2005/07/24 01:42:58  arthchan2003
 * Added whmm_alloc_light, that will by-pass and not use any internal list inside whmm.c
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.2  2005/07/17 05:57:25  arthchan2003
 * 1, Removed wid from the argument list of eval_*_whmm, 2, Allow  allocation of whmm_alloc to be more flexible.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.1  2005/07/15 07:48:32  arthchan2003
 * split the hmm (whmm_t) and context building process (ctxt_table_t) from the the flat_fwd.c

/**
 * \struct whmm_t
 * \brief Word HMM instance: the basic structure searched during recognition.
 * 
 * whmm[w] = head of list of all active HMM for word w:
 * 	Will only contain active HMM in current frame.
 * 	List ordered by pronunciation position within word.
 * 	If last phone is active, right context instances ordered as in rcpid or lrcpid
 * 
 * The triphone modelled by a given whmm_t is normally obtained by
 * looking up wwpid or rcpid above, using whmm_t.pos and whmm_t.rc.
 * However, left context modelling, unlike right context, is done not
 * by explicit fanout but by multiplexing a single whmm_t structure
 * among all possible instantiations (for all possible left context
 * ciphones).  Each state can be from a different triphone
 * instantiation.  whmm_t.pid[] used for these triphone ids.  
 * (This is probably worse than no explanation.)
 *
 * ARCHAN : Augmented at 20050824
 * 
 * This is how this data structure works and admittedly it is fairly
 * tricky.  When whmm_t is used for normal triphones. (i.e. When we
 * try to model word-internal triphones or any triphone which is
 * full-blown), then one whmm_t will be one such triphone.  In that
 * case, the pointer pid will *point to* (not equal to) one single
 * triphone ID. There is nothing tricky about that. 
 *
 * However, when a multiplexed triphone is used, then the situation
 * will be tricky.  So what is multiplexing in the first place?
 * 
 * It is a technique mainly for **initial phone** and we are
 * considering all **left contexts**.  So just imagine, we are
 * entering a phone from multiple active word-ends. Now, if the
 * triphone is implemented in full, then for each word-end, one will
 * need to allocate one whmm_t to store the context for the word-end.
 *
 * Multiplex triphones though, doesn't require that, when multiple
 * word-ends are entered, only the best pid will be stored in the
 * **first state**.  Another interesting thing is that the best pid
 * will be propagated through the HMM, just like state backtracker or
 * the score. 
 *
 * Notice the state-based pid is, as it's named, state-based.
 * Therefore, when an hmm is in the multiplexed mode, pid will be used
 * as an **array of pid** instead of a **pointer of pid**.  That is
 * why they were handled pretty differently in general in the code
 * (such as flat_fwd.c and ctxt_table.c)
 *
 * Some historical note, at the beginning, this structure only
 * considered right-context, I have changed it to handle left-context
 * as well. However, as I have started to use the flag -multiplex to
 * control the behavior of the search.  I still keep the convention of
 * above.  I will say that is more a pragmatic measure rather a
 * correct measure.
