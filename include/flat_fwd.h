 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2006/04/05  20:27:30  dhdfu
 * A Great Reorganzation of header files and executables
 * 
 * Revision 1.12  2006/02/23 05:25:32  arthchan2003
 * Merged from branch SPHINX3_5_2_RCI_IRII_BRANCH: Most of the functions are removed and now resided in srch_flat_fwd.h
 *
 * Revision 1.10.4.7  2005/11/17 06:27:48  arthchan2003
 * 1, Clean up. 2, removed fwg in dag_build.
 *
 * Revision 1.10.4.6  2005/10/26 03:53:12  arthchan2003
 * Put add_fudge and remove_filler_nodes into srch_flat_fwd.c . This conformed to s3.0 behavior.
 *
 * Revision 1.10.4.5  2005/09/18 01:18:24  arthchan2003
 * Only retain processing of the array whmm_t in flat_fwd.[ch]
 *
 * Revision 1.10.4.4  2005/09/11 02:58:10  arthchan2003
 * remove most dag-related functions except dag_build. Use latticehist_t insteads of loosed arrays.
 *
 * Revision 1.10.4.3  2005/09/07 23:40:06  arthchan2003
 * Several Bug Fixes and Enhancements to the flat-lexicon
 * 1, Fixed Dox-doc.
 * 2, Add -worddumpef and -hmmdumpef in parrallel to -worddumpsf and
 * -hmmdumpsf. Usage is trivial. a structure called fwd_dbg_t now wrapped
 * up all these loose parameters.  Methods of fwd_dbg are implemented.
 * 3, word_ugprob is now initialized by init_word_ugprob
 * 4, Full-triphone expansion is implemented. User can change this
 * behavior by specifying -multiplex_multi and -multiplex_single. The
 * former turn on multiplex triphone for word-begin for multi-phone word.
 * The latter do that for single-phone word. Turning off both could
 * tremendously increase computation.
 * 5, Word expansions of possible right contexts now records independent
 * history.  The behavior in the past was to use only one history for a
 * word.
 *
 * Revision 1.10.4.2  2005/08/02 21:12:45  arthchan2003
 * Changed senlist from 8-bit to 32-bit. It will be compatible to the setting of ascr's sen_active.
 *
 * Revision 1.10.4.1  2005/07/15 07:50:33  arthchan2003
 * Remove hmm computation and context building code from flat_fwd.c.

    * SOME ASSUMPTIONS
    *   - All phones (ciphones and triphones) have same HMM topology with n_state states.
    *   - Initial state = state 0; final state = state n_state-1.
    *   - Final state is a non-emitting state with no arcs out of it.
    *   - Some form of Bakis topology (ie, no cycles, except for self-transitions).

 * Build a DAG from the lattice: each unique <word-id,start-frame> is a node, i.e. with

 * whenever nodes are adjacent in time.
 * dagnodes_list = linear list of DAG nodes allocated, ordered such that nodes earlier
 * in the list can follow nodes later in the list, but not vice versa:  Let two DAG
 * nodes d1 and d2 have start times sf1 and sf2, and end time ranges [fef1..lef1] and
 * [fef2..lef2] respectively.  If d1 appears later than d2 in dag.list, then
 * fef2 >= fef1, because d2 showed up later in the word lattice.  If there is a DAG
 * edge from d1 to d2, then sf1 > fef2.  But fef2 >= fef1, so sf1 > fef1.  Reductio ad
 * absurdum.
