 * Revision 1.1  2006/04/05  20:27:30  dhdfu
 * A Great Reorganzation of header files and executables
 * 
 * Revision 1.2  2006/02/23 05:15:12  arthchan2003
 * Merged from branch SPHINX3_5_2_RCI_IRII_BRANCH: Word graphs with word attached to links. Now mainly used in conversion from Sphinx to IBM format
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.1  2005/11/17 06:39:30  arthchan2003
 * Added a structure for linked-based lattice.
