 * HISTORY
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2006/04/05  20:27:30  dhdfu
 * A Great Reorganzation of header files and executables
 * 
 * Revision 1.3  2006/02/22 19:37:51  arthchan2003
 * Removed command-line remove_zero_var_gau.  See the comments in revision 1.20 of cont_mgau.c
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2006/02/22 18:46:43  arthchan2003
 * Merged from SPHINX3_5_2_RCI_IRII_BRANCH: Add a macro files that
 * unified the command line of all the executables in Sphinx 3.6.
 * Affected executable includes decode, decode_anytopo, livepretend,
 * align, allphone, dag, astar and conf.  This will be commmented
 * individually in each executable.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.14  2006/01/16 19:50:19  arthchan2003
 * 1, Changed -ltsoov to -lts_mismatch, 2, Added an option to unscale the hypothesis segment scores. , 3, Added an option to dump the best senone scores.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.13  2005/11/17 06:11:15  arthchan2003
 * 1, Added -hypsegfmt which allows output of hyp(match)seg to s3, s2 and ctm segment format. 2, Added -outlatfmt, which allows conversion of sphinx 3 lattice to IBM lattice. 3, -latcompress, create an uncompressed(in terms of no. of links) version of dag.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.12  2005/10/07 18:55:10  arthchan2003
 * Fixed the display problem.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.11  2005/09/26 02:32:34  arthchan2003
 * (Change for comments) Also set agc default to none instead of max. The reason is that all 8 tests we have in the performance do not use -agc max. Also in practice, AGC usually hurt the performance.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.10  2005/09/26 02:21:57  arthchan2003
 * Changed the option -s3hmmdir to -hmm. This seems to be more generic and cause fewer restraints in future.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.9  2005/09/25 19:04:23  arthchan2003
 * Added macros for 1, tie routines which used vq_gen, 2, add support for using LTS rules to generate OOV. 3, enable and disable composite triphone support.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.8  2005/09/18 01:14:58  arthchan2003
 * Tie Viterbi history, DAG, debugging command line together.  Inspect all possible commands and specify whether they are mode-specific.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.7  2005/09/07 23:27:21  arthchan2003
 * Added an option in gmm_command_line_macro() to allow multiple behavior of Gaussian flooring.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.6  2005/08/03 19:58:11  arthchan2003
 * Change -topn from fast_GMM macro to acoustic model command line
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.5  2005/08/03 18:53:59  dhdfu
 * Add -topn for SCHMM models
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.4  2005/08/02 21:08:32  arthchan2003
 * 1, Changed -mean, -var, -tmat, -mixw -mdef to make them not required arguments. 2, Added -s3hmmdir so that user can just specified a directory name, in which all components of a set of HMM could be found.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.3  2005/07/24 01:43:59  arthchan2003
 * Temporarily not support -fsgctlfn
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.2  2005/07/20 19:43:44  arthchan2003
 * Add command line arguments for fsg routines.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.1  2005/07/18 18:56:20  arthchan2003
 * A centralized macro definition file that contains command-line information that shared by different applications.

/* Note by ARCHAN at 20050717 
   
The following are macros that used by individual modules and
routines. Since we want in one application, there is only one
command-line arguments. (The concept of singleton in Pattern).  If
we used variables, then every application that call this file and
its implementation will need got every command-line from every
application. That is not very nice. 

Using macro will temporarily solve this problem and I hope this
will only last for less than one minor version time.  A better way,
as what we have already done in Sphinx 4, is to ask the libraries
to register its command-line argument as well as configuration
arguments.  This will give user a better time of configuration and
us a better architecture.
