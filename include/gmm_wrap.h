/* gmm_wrap.h
 * HISTORY
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2006/04/05  20:27:30  dhdfu
 * A Great Reorganzation of header files and executables
 * 
 * Revision 1.3  2006/02/23 05:38:39  arthchan2003
 * Merged from the branch SPHINX3_5_2_RCI_IRII_BRANCH: Added multi-stream GMM computation routine.
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.1.4.3  2005/08/02 21:31:35  arthchan2003
 * Added interface for 1, doing multi stream gmm computation with/without composite senone. 2, doing gmm computation (ms or ss optimized) with/wihout composite senone.  Haven't tested on the SCHMM on s3.x yet.  I think it will work though.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.4.2  2005/07/24 01:35:41  arthchan2003
 * Add a wrapper for computing senone score without computing composite senone score. Mainly used in mode FSG now
 *
 * Revision 1.1.4.1  2005/06/27 05:30:25  arthchan2003
 * Merge from the tip of the trunk
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/06/22 08:00:09  arthchan2003
 * Completed all doxygen documentation on file description for libs3decoder/libutil/libs3audio and programs.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/06/21 22:48:14  arthchan2003
 * A wrapper that provide the function pointer interface of approx_cont_mgau_ci_eval  and approx_cont_mgau_frame_eval.  They are used in srch_gmm_compute_lv1  and srch_gmm_compute_lv2 respectively.  This will also be the home of other gmm computation routine. (Say the s3.0 version of GMM computation)
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/06/13 04:02:59  archan
 * Fixed most doxygen-style documentation under libs3decoder.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/04/22 04:22:37  archan
 * Add gmm_wrap, this will share code across op_mode 4 and op_mode 5. Also it also separate active senone selection into a different process.  I hope this is the final step before making the WST search works.  At the current stage, the code of mode-5 looks very much alike mode-4.  This is intended because in Prototype 4, tail sharing will be used to reduce memory.
