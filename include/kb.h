 * HISTORY
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2006/04/05  20:27:30  dhdfu
 * A Great Reorganzation of header files and executables
 * 
 * Revision 1.18  2006/02/23 05:44:59  arthchan2003
 * Merged from the branch SPHINX3_5_2_RCI_IRII_BRANCH.
 * 1, Added temp_init_vithistory, this will choose to initialize the correct viterbi history given the mode.
 * 2, Moved most of the code in kb_setmllr to adaptor.c
 *
 * Revision 1.17.4.2  2005/09/18 01:21:18  arthchan2003
 * 1, Add a latticehist_t into kb_t, use a temporary method to allow polymorphism of initialization of vithist_t and latticehist_t. 2, remove the logic kb_set_mllr and put it to adapt_set_mllr
 *
 * Revision 1.17.4.1  2005/07/03 23:00:58  arthchan2003
 * Free stat_t, histprune_t and srch_t correctly.
 *
 * Revision 1.17  2005/06/21 23:21:58  arthchan2003
 * Log. This is a big refactoring for kb.c and it is worthwhile to give
 * words on why and how things were done.  There were generally a problem
 * that the kb structure itself is too flat.  That makes it has to
 * maintained many structure that could be maintained by smaller
 * structures.  For example, the count of A and the array of A should
 * well be put into the same structure to increase readability and
 * modularity. One can explain why histprune_t, pl_t, stat_t and
 * adapt_am_t were introduced with that line of reasoning.
 *
 * In srch_t, polymorphism of implementation is also one important
 * element in separting all graph related members from kb_t to srch_t.
 * One could probably implement the polymorphism as an interface of kb
 * but it is not trivial from the semantic meaning of kb.  That is
 * probably why srch_t is introduced as the gateway of search interfaces.
 *
 * Another phenonemon one could see in the code was bad interaction
 * between modules. This is quite serious in two areas: logging and
 * checking. The current policy is unless something required cross
 * checking two structures, they would be done internally inside a module
 * initialization.
 *
 * Finally, kb_setlm is now removed and is replaced by ld_set_lm (by
 * users) or srch_set_lm (by developers). I think this is quite
 * reasonable.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2005/06/19 19:41:23  archan
 * Sphinx3 to s3.generic: Added multiple regression class for single stream MLLR. Enabled MLLR for livepretend and decode.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2005/05/11 06:10:38  archan
 * Code for lattice and back track pointer table dumping is now wrapped in reg_result_dump.  The function is shared across mode 4 and mode 5.  Possibly later for mode 3 and mode 6 as well.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2005/04/25 23:53:35  archan
 * 1, Some minor modification of vithist_t, vithist_rescore can now support optional LM rescoring, vithist also has its own reporting routine. A new argument -lmrescore is also added in decode and livepretend.  This can switch on and off the rescoring procedure. 2, I am reaching the final difficulty of mode 5 implementation.  That is, to implement an algorithm which dynamically decide which tree copies should be entered.  However, stuffs like score propagation in the leave nodes and non-leaves nodes are already done. 3, As briefly mentioned in 2, implementation of rescoring , which used to happened at leave nodes are now separated. The current implementation is not the most clever one. Wish I have time to change it before check-in to the canonical.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2005/04/20 03:36:18  archan
 * Remove setlm from kb entirely, refactor it to search implementations, do the corresponding change for the changes in ascr and pl
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2005/03/30 01:22:47  archan
 * Fixed mistakes in last updates. Add
 *
 * 
 * 14-Jun-2004  Yitao Sun (yitao@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *              Modified struct kb_t to save the last hypothesis.
 *
 * 07-Jul-1999	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added kb_t.ci_active.
 * 
 * 02-Jun-1999	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Started.
