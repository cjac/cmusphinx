 * HISTORY
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2006/04/05  20:27:30  dhdfu
 * A Great Reorganzation of header files and executables
 * 
 * Revision 1.3  2006/02/22 14:48:13  arthchan2003
 * Merged from SPHINX3_5_2_RCI_IRII_BRANCH: Added adapt_set_mllr (Moved from kb)
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.1.4.3  2005/09/18 01:12:31  arthchan2003
 * Add adapt_set_mllr which is responsible for single stream MLLR switching.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.4.2  2005/07/05 05:47:59  arthchan2003
 * Fixed dox-doc. struct level of documentation are included.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.4.1  2005/06/27 05:22:19  arthchan2003
 * Merged from the HEAD.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/06/22 08:00:07  arthchan2003
 * Completed all doxygen documentation on file description for libs3decoder/libutil/libs3audio and programs.
 * Revision 1.2  2005/06/22 08:00:07  arthchan2003
 * Completed all doxygen documentation on file description for libs3decoder/libutil/libs3audio and programs.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/06/21 17:59:44  arthchan2003
 * Log: Implementation and Interface of adapt_am_t, a wrapper of
 * adaptation capabability of Sphinx 3.  It takes the responsibility from
 * kb_t to manage regA, regB and mllr_nclass.  Interfaces are not fully
 * completed. So "pointer" symtom code still appears in kb.c
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2005/06/19 19:41:21  archan
 * Sphinx3 to s3.generic: Added multiple regression class for single stream MLLR. Enabled MLLR for livepretend and decode.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/03/30 01:08:37  archan
 * codebase-wide update. Performed an age-old trick: Adding $Log into all .c and .h files. This will make sure the commit message be preprended into a file.
 *
 * 
 * 25-Mar-2005  Arthur Chan (archan@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon Unversity
 *              First started.
