 * Initial CVS repository
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2001/12/11 00:24:48  lenzo
 * Acknowledgement in License.
 *

 * License.xsxc
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2001/12/07 04:27:35  lenzo
 * License cleanup.  Remove conditions on the names.  Rationale: These
 * conditions don't belong in the license itself, but in other fora that
 * offer protection for recognizeable names such as "Carnegie Mellon
 * University" and "Sphinx."  These changes also reduce interoperability
 * issues with other licenses such as the Mozilla Public License and the
 * GPL.  This update changes the top-level license files and removes the
 * old license conditions from each of the files that contained it.
 * All files in this collection fall under the copyright of the top-level
 * LICENSE file.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2001/11/20 21:22:37  lenzo
 * Win32 re-compatibility fixes.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2000/12/05 01:45:12  lenzo
 * Restructuring, hear rationalization, warning removal, ANSIfy
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2000/01/28 22:08:59  lenzo
 * Initial import of sphinx2
 *
 *
 *  8-Sep-92  Fil Alleva (faa) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	dec'l of CHAN.model[] changed from int16 to int32.
 *
 * Spring 89, Fil Alleva (faa) at Carnegie Mellon
 *	Created
 *------------------------------------------------------------*
 * BUGS
 *	We assume that there are *always* 6 nodes per model and
 * never more then 3 transition out of a node. In addition to that
 * we also make use of the fact that every model has the same base
 * topology. To that end we use memory occupied by unused transitions
 * for model bookkeeping variables.
