/* srch_debug.h
 * HISTORY
 * 
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2006/04/05  20:27:30  dhdfu
 * A Great Reorganzation of header files and executables
 * 
 * Revision 1.3  2006/02/28 02:06:46  egouvea
 * Updated MS Visual C++ 6.0 support files. Fixed things that didn't
 * compile in Visual C++ (declarations didn't match, etc). There are
 * still some warnings, so this is not final. Also, sorted files in
 * several Makefile.am.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2006/02/23 15:50:25  arthchan2003
 * Merged from branch SPHINX3_5_2_RCI_IRII_BRANCH: Fixed dox-doc, Added empty functions into srch_debug.[ch]
 *
 * Revision 1.1.4.1  2006/01/16 20:02:08  arthchan2003
 * Added interfaces for second stage operations
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/06/22 02:37:41  arthchan2003
 * Log. A search debugging implementation.  Users will only see a text
 * message provided in this search implementation.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2005/05/11 06:10:39  archan
 * Code for lattice and back track pointer table dumping is now wrapped in reg_result_dump.  The function is shared across mode 4 and mode 5.  Possibly later for mode 3 and mode 6 as well.
 *
 *
 * 17-Mar-2005 A. Chan (archan@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *             Started. Time switching tree implementation.

   \file srch_debug.h
   \brief implementation of search debug mode. 
   
   ARCHAN 20050510: An empty search structure. Only used for
   debugging.  Debug mode implementation is useful when programmers
   just want to test out a logic change in srch.c but do not want to
   waste the time in running actual decoding.
