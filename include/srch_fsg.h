/* srch_fsg.h
 * HISTORY
 * 
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2006/04/05  20:27:30  dhdfu
 * A Great Reorganzation of header files and executables
 * 
 * Revision 1.2  2006/02/23 05:11:38  arthchan2003
 * Merged from branch SPHINX3_5_2_RCI_IRII_BRANCH: Adaptation of Sphinx 2's FSG search into Sphinx 3
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.7  2006/01/16 20:12:42  arthchan2003
 * Interfaces for the 2nd-stage search. Now commented.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.6  2005/09/18 01:45:43  arthchan2003
 * Clean up the interfaces for srch_fsg.[ch]
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.5  2005/07/26 02:20:39  arthchan2003
 * merged hyp_t with srch_hyp_t.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.4  2005/07/24 01:41:18  arthchan2003
 * Filled in all function pointers for mode 2
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.3  2005/07/20 21:18:30  arthchan2003
 * FSG can now be read, srch_fsg_init can now be initialized, psubtree can be built. Sounds like it is time to plug in other function pointers.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.2  2005/06/28 07:01:21  arthchan2003
 * General fix of fsg routines to make a prototype of fsg_init and fsg_read. Not completed.  The number of empty functions in fsg_search is now decreased from 35 to 30.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.1  2005/06/27 05:27:09  arthchan2003
 * Fixed added srch_fsg.[ch] and replace it by srch_fsm.c
