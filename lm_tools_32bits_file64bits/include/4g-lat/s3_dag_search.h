 * HISTORY
 * 
 * $Log: search.h,v $
 * Revision 1.2  2004/08/31 08:43:47  arthchan2003
 * Fixing _cpluscplus directive
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/08/09 00:17:12  arthchan2003
 * Incorporating s3.0 align, at this point, there are still some small problems in align but they don't hurt. For example, the score doesn't match with s3.0 and the output will have problem if files are piped to /dev/null/. I think we can go for it.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2002/12/03 23:02:44  egouvea
 * Updated slow decoder with current working version.
 * Added copyright notice to Makefiles, *.c and *.h files.
 * Updated some of the documentation.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/12/03 20:20:46  robust
 * Import of s3decode.
 *
 * 
 * 07-Nov-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *  		Added onlynodes argument to dag_dump().
 * 
 * 12-Sep-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Changed fwd_sen_active to flag active senones instead of building a list
 * 		of them.
 *  
 * 24-Jun-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added dag_search().
 * 
 * 20-Jan-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added function fwd_sen_active() to obtain list of active senones in
 * 		current frame.
 * 
 * 04-Dec-95	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Started.
