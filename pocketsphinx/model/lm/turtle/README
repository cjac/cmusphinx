This directory contains a few files that sphinx2 can use for
a simple "turtle graphics" or robot directing task.

  turtle.corpus  is the original corpus as given to the lmtool web page.
                 see the main website for more info at
                   
                     http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sphinx/

  turtle.dic     the pronunciation dictionary for the task

  turtle.handdict where you add your own pronuciations (a hand-made
                  dictionary)

  turtle.lm      the actual ARPABO language model for the task

  turtle.sent    the sentences as they were actually processed

  turtle.token   token counts for each 'word'

  turtle.vocab   the vocabulary of the task

  goforward.16k a raw, 16-bit 16kHz audio file containing the utterance
                'go forward ten meters'

Not all of these are needed, but they're all here.
