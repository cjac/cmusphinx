    <P>Sphinx-3 is the successor to the Sphinx-II speech recognition
    system from Carnegie Mellon University.  It includes both an
    acoustic <em>trainer</em> and various <em>decoders</em>,
    <em>i.e.</em>, text recognition, phoneme recognition, N-best list
    generation, etc. In this document, "Sphinx-3" refers to any
    version of the Sphinx-3 decoder, and "s3.X" refers to the version
    available in this distribution. Notice that s3.X is in fact a
    branch from Sphinx-3, not a more recent release.
    </P>
    
    <P>The s3.X decoder is a recent implementation for speech-to-text
    recognition, its main goal being speed improvements over the
    original Sphinx-3 decoder.  It runs about 10 times faster than the
    latter on large vocabulary tasks.  The following is a brief
    summary of its main features and limitations:
    </P>

    <UL>
      <LI>5-10x real-time recognition time on large vocabulary tasks</LI>
      <LI>Limited to fully continuous acoustic models</LI>
      <LI>Limited to 3 or 5-state left-to-right HMM topologies</LI>
      <LI>Bigram or trigram language model</LI>
      <LI>Batch-mode or live operation from pre-recorded speech</LI>
    </UL>
    
    <P> After s3.5, s3.X decoder also starts to integrate both the
    flat-lexicon decoder search, tree decoder search by wrapping them
    under the same interface.  An implementation of finite-state
    transducer search is also available under the same condition.  
    </P> 

    <P> All of the decoding routines could be accessible under the
    executable <code> sphinx3_decode </code> through using the <code>
    -op_mode </mode> options.  (-op_mode 2: FST, -op_mode 3: Flat
    Lexicon Decoder, -op_mode: Tree Lexicon Decoder) The original
    flat-lexicon decoder interface still exists for backward
    compatibility purpose. 
    </P> 

    <P>This package contains the following programs:
    </P>
    <OL>
      <LI><code>sphinx3_decode</code>: The Sphinx-3 s3.2/s3.3/s3.X decoder processing cesptra files</li>

    <P>This distribution has been prepared for Unix platforms. Port to
    MS Windows (MS Visual C++ 6.0 workspace and project files) has
    been provided. 
    </P>

    <P>This document is a brief user's manual for the above programs.
    It is <em>not</em> meant to be a detailed description of the
    decoding algorithm, or an in-depth tutorial on speech recognition
    technology.  However, a set of Microsoft PowerPoint <a
    href="s3-2.ppt">slides</a> are available that give additional
    information about the decoder. Even though the slides refer to
    s3.2, keep in mind that the basic search structure remains te same
    in s3.X (where x=3 to 6). 
    </P>
    
    <P>The initial part of this document provides an overview of the
    decoder.  It is followed by descriptions of the main input and
    output databases; <em>i.e.</em>, the lexicon, language model, acoustic
    model, etc.

    <H2><A NAME="sec_decoverview"><U>Overview of the s3.X Decoder</U></A></H2>
    
    <P>The s3.X decoder is based on the conventional <em>Viterbi
    search</em> algorithm and <em>beam search</em> heuristics.  It
    uses a <em>lexical-tree</em> search structure somewhat like the
    Sphinx-II decoder, but with some improvements for greater accuracy
    than the latter. It takes its input from pre-recorded speech in
    raw PCM format and writes its recognition results to output files.
    </P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="sec_dec_input"><U>Inputs</U></A></H3>
    
    <P>We first give a brief outline of the input and output
    characteristics of the decoder.  More detailed information is
    available in later sections.  The decoder needs the following
    inputs:
    </P>
    <UL>
      <LI><a href="#sec_dict"><em>Lexical model</em></a>: The
      lexical or pronunciation model contains pronunciations for all
      the words of interest to the decoder.  Like most modern speech
      recognition systems, Sphinx-3 uses <em>phonetic units</em> to
      build word pronunciations.  Currently, the pronunciation lexicon
      is almost entirely hand-crafted.
      </LI>
      <P></P>
    
      <LI><a href="#sec_am"><em>Acoustic model</em></a>: Sphinx
      uses acoustic models based on statistical <em>hidden Markov
      models</em> (HMMs).  The acoustic model is trained from acoustic
      training data using the Sphinx-3 trainer.  The trainer is
      capable of building acoustic models with a wide range of
      structures, such as <em>discrete</em>, <em>semi-continuous</em>,
      or <em>continuous</em>.  However, the s3.X decoder is only
      capable of handling continuous acoustic models.
      </LI>
      <P></P>
      
      <LI><a href="#sec_lm"><em>Language model (LM)</em></a>:
      Sphinx-3 uses a conventional backoff bigram or trigram language
      model.
      </LI>
      <P></P>
      
      <LI><a href="#sec_ctl"><em>Speech input specification</em></a>:
      This distribution contains four executable files, three of which
      perform recognition. <code>sphinx3_livedecode</code> decodes live
      speech, that is, speech incoming from your audio
      card. <code>sphinx3_livepretend</code> decodes in batch mode using a
      <em>control file</em> that describes the input to be decoded
      into text. <code>sphinx3_decode</code> decodes also uses a control file
      for batch mode processing. In the latter, the entire input to be
      processed must be available beforehand, <em>i.e.</em>, the raw
      audio samples must have been preprocessed into cepstrum
      files. Also note that the decoder cannot handle arbitrary
      lengths of speech input.  Each separate piece (or
      <em>utterance</em>) to be processed by the decoder must be no
      more than 300 sec. long.  Typically, one uses a
      <em>segmenter</em> to chop up a cepstrum stream into manageable
      segments of up to 20 or 30 sec. duration.
      </LI>

    <H3><A NAME="sec_dec_output"><U>Outputs</U></A></H3>
    
    <P>The decoder can produce two types of recognition output:
    </P>
    <UL>
      <LI><a href="#sec_hypseg"><em>Recognition hypothesis</em></a>: A
      single best recognition result (or <em>hypothesis</em>) for each
      utterance processed.  It is a linear word sequence, with
      additional attributes such as their time segmentation and
      scores.
      </LI>
      <P></P>
      
      <LI><a href="#sec_wordlat"><em>Word lattice</em></a>: A
      word-graph of all possible candidate words recognized during the
      decoding of an utterance, including other attributes such as
      their time segmentation and acoustic likelihood scores.
      </LI>
    </UL>
    
    <P>In addition, the decoder also produces a detailed log to
    stdout/stderr that can be useful in debugging, gathering
    statistics, etc.

    <H2><A NAME="sec_compile"><u>Compiling s3.X</u></A></H2>
    
    <P>The current distribution has been set up for Unix platforms.
    The following steps are needed to compile the decoder:
    </P> 
 
    <P> For Users: </P> 
    <OL>
      <LI><code>./configure [--prefix=/my/install/directory]</code>:
      the argument is optional. If not given, it will install s3.X
      under /usr/local, provided you have the proper permissions. This
      step is only necessary the first time you compile s3.X.</LI>

      <LI><code>make clean</code>: This should remove any old object
      files.</LI> 

      <LI><code>make</code>: This compiles the libraries and example
      programs.</LI>

      <LI><code>make install</code>: This will install s3.X in the
      directory that you specified when you ran <code>configure</code>
      and also the provided models and documentation.</LI>
    </OL>
    
    <P>Note that the Makefiles are not foolproof; they do not eliminate
    the need for sometimes manually determining dependencies,
    especially upon updates to header files.  When in doubt, first
    clean out the compilation directories entirely by running
    <code>make distclean</code> and start over.

    <P> For Developers </P> 
    <OL> 
	<LI> The project could be boostrap from the SVN repository
	which
	could be obtained by command <code> svn co https://cmusphinx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cmusphinx/trunk/sphinx3 </code>  </LI> 
	<LI> One could boostrap the installation by typing command <code> ./autogen.sh ; ./autogen.sh </LI>

    <H2><A NAME="sec_exec"><u>Running s3.X</u></A></H2>
    
    <P>Running the decoder is simply a matter of invoking the binary
    (<em>i.e.</em>, <code>sphinx3_decode</code>, <code>sphinx3_livedecode</code> or
    <code>sphinx3_livepretend</code>), with a number of command line arguments
    specifying the various input files, as well as decoding
    configuration parameters. <code>sphinx3_decode</code> and
    <code>sphinx3_livepretend</code> require a control file, the directory
    where the audio files are available, and a file containing the
    configuration arguments. <code>sphinx3_livedecode</code>, which runs live,
    requires only the file with the arguments.
    </p>

    <P>Invoking the binary without any argument produces a <a
    href="cmdhelp.txt">help message</a> with short descriptions of all
    the configuration arguments.

    <P>This section gives a brief overview of the main configuration
    arguments.  They are broken down into separate groups, based on
    whether they are the primary flags specifying input and output
    data, arguments for optional configuration, or for performance
    tuning.
    </P>
    
    <P>Note that not all the available configuration arguments are
    covered below.  There are a few additional and undocumented flags,
    intended mainly for debugging purposes.

    newcomer to Sphinx can get an idea of the structure, capabilities,
    and limitations of the s3.X decoder.
    </P>



    <H4><A name="sec_dec_init"><U>Initialization</U></a></H4>
    
    <P>The decoder is configured during the initialization step, and
    the configuration holds for the entire run.  This means, for
    example, that the decoder does not dynamically reconfigure the
    acoustic models to <em>adapt</em> to the input.  To choose another
    example, there is no mechanism in this decoder to switch language
    models from utterance to utterance, unlike in Sphinx-II.
    The main initialization steps are outlined below.
    </P>

    <P><b>Log-Base Initialization.</b> Sphinx performs all likelihood
    computations in the log-domain.  Furthermore, for computational
    efficiency, the <em>base</em> of the logarithm is chosen such that
    the likelihoods can be maintained as 32-bit integer values.  Thus,
    all the scores reported by the decoder are <em>log-likelihood</em>
    values in this peculiar log-base.  The default base is typically
    1.0003, and can be changed using the <code>-logbase</code>
    configuration argument.  The main reason for modifying the
    log-base would be to control the length (duration) of an input
    utterance before the accumulated log-likelihood values overflow
    the 32-bit representation, causing the decoder to fail
    catastrophically.  The log-base can be changed over a wide range
    without affecting the recognition.
    </P>

    <P><b>Models Initialization.</b> The lexical, acoustic, and
    language models specified via the configuration arguments are
    loaded during initialization.  This set of models is used to
    decode all the utterances in the input.  (The language model is
    actually only partly loaded, since s3.X uses a <a
    href="#lm_dumpfile">disk-based LM</a> strategy.)
    </P>

    <P><b>Effective Vocabulary.</b> After the models are loaded,
    the <em>effective vocabulary</em> is determined.  It is the set of
    words that the decoder is capable of recognizing.  Recall that the
    decoder is initialized with three sources of words: the <a
    href="#dict_main_filler">main and filler lexicon</a> files, and
    the <a href="#sec_lm">language model</a>.  The effective
    vocabulary is determined from them as follows:
    </P>
    <OL>
      <LI>Find the intersection of the words in the LM and the main
      pronunciation lexicon</LI>

      <LI>Include all the alternative pronunciations to the set
      derived above (using the main lexicon)</LI>

      <LI>Include all the filler words from the filler lexicon, but
      excluding the distinguished beginning and end of sentence words:
      <code>&lt;s&gt</code> and <code>&lt;/s&gt</code>.</LI>
    </OL>
    <P>The effective vocabulary remains in effect throughout the batch
    run.  It is not possible to add to or remove from this vocabulary
    dynamically, unlike in the Sphinx-II system.
    </P>

    <P><b>Lexical Tree Construction.</b> The decoder constructs
    <em>lexical trees</em> from the effective vocabulary described
    above.  Separate trees are constructed for words in the <a
    href="#dict_main_filler">main and filler lexicons</a>.
    Furthermore, several copies may be instantiated for the two,
    depending on the <code>-Nlextree</code> configuration argument.
    Further details of the lexical tree construction are available on
    the PowerPoint <a href="s3-2.ppt">slides</a>.
    </P>



    <H4><A name="sec_ctl_process"><U>Control File Processing</U></a></H4>

    <P>Following initialization, <code>sphinx3_decode</code> and
    <code>sphinx3_livepretend</code> processes the entries in the control file
    sequentially, one at a time.  It is possible to process a
    contiguous subset of the control file, using the
    <code>-ctloffset</code> and <code>-ctlcount</code> flags, as
    mentioned earlier.  There is no learning or <em>adaptation</em>
    capability as decoding progresses.  Since <code>sphinx3_livepretend</code>
    behaves as if the files were being spoken at the time of
    processing, rearranging the order of the entries in the control
    file may affect the individual results, but this change may be
    imperceptible if the environment in which the files were recorded
    remains constant. The order of entries in the control file does
    not affect <code>sphinx3_decode</code>.
    </P>



    <H4><A name="sec_dec_prune"><U>Pruning</U></a></H4>

    <P>Each entry in the control file, or utterance, is processed
    using the given input models, and using the <em>Viterbi search
    algorithm</em>.  In order to constrain the active search space to
    computationally manageable limits, <em>pruning</em> is employed,
    which means that the less promising hypotheses are continually
    discarded during the recognition process.  There are two kinds of
    pruning in s3.X, <em>beam pruning</em> and <em>absolute
    pruning</em>.
    </P>

    <P><b>Beam Pruning.</b> Each utterance is processed in a
    <em>time-synchronous</em> manner, one frame at a time.  At each
    frame the decoder has a number of currently <em>active</em> HMMs
    to match with the next frame of input speech.  But it first
    discards or deactivates those whose state likelihoods are below
    some <em>threshold</em>, relative to the best HMM state likelihood at
    that time.  The threshold value is obtained by
    <em>multiplying</em> the best state likelihood by a fixed
    <em>beamwidth</em>.  The beamwidth is a value between 0 and 1, the
    former permitting all HMMs to survive, and the latter permitting
    only the best scoring HMMs to survive.
    </P>
    
    <P>Similar beam pruning is also used in a number of other
    situations in the decoder, e.g., to determine the candidate words
    recognized at any time, or to determine the component densities in
    a mixture Gaussian that are closest to a given speech feature
    vector.  The various beamwidths have to be determined empirically
    and are set using <a href="#sec_flags_tune">configuration
    arguments</a>.
    </P>

    <P><b>Absolute Pruning.</b> Even with beam pruning, the number of
    active entities can sometimes become computationally overwhelming.
    If there are a large number of HMMs that fall within the pruning
    threshold, the decoder will keep all of them active.  However,
    when the number of active HMMs grows beyond certain limits, the
    chances of detecting the correct word among the many candidates
    are considerably reduced.  Such situations can occur, for example,
    if the input speech is noisy or quite mismatched to the acoustic
    models.  In such cases, there is no point in allowing the active
    search space to grow to arbitrary extents.  It can be contained
    using pruning parameters that limit the <em>absolute number</em>
    of active entities at any instant.  These parameters are also
    determined empirically, and set using <a
    href="#sec_flags_tune">configuration arguments</a>.
    </P>

    <H4><A name="sec_gmm_compute"><U>(After s3.4) Fast GMM
    Computation</U></a></H4>

    <p> The computation of likelihood Gaussian distribution can be one
    of the dominating factor of the GMM computation. Tuning the
    following parameters can control the amount of time required.  </p>

    <ul>
      <LI><code>-ci_pbeam</code>: Enable a two-pass computation where
      CI models were computed first and the CD models were then
      computed.  If this beam is used, only CD models, which correspond
      to CI models within the beam (relative to the max CI scores), are
      computed </LI>
      <LI><code>-maxcdsenpf</code>: Similar to <code> -ci_pbeam
      </code> but the beam is decided by an absolute number of senones
      computd.  </LI>
      <LI><code>-ds  </code> : Enable frame down-sampling. Only 1
      another N frames were computed.  </LI>
    </ul>

    <H4><U>Output Generation</U></H4>

    <P>During recognition, the decoder builds an internal
    <em>backpointer table</em> data structure, from which the final
    outputs are generated.  This table records all the candidate words
    recognized during decoding, and their attributes such as their
    time segmentation, acoustic and LM likelihoods, as well as their
    predecessor entries in the table.  When an utterance has been
    fully processed, the best <a href="#sec_hypseg">recognition
    hypothesis</a> is extracted from this table.  Optionally, the
    table is also converted into a <a
    href="#sec_wordlat">word-lattice</a> and written out to a file.
    </P>
    
    <P>More information on the backpointer table is available in the
    PowerPoint <a href="s3-2.ppt">slides</a>.
    </P>


    <H4><U>Miscellaneous Issues</U></H4>

    <P><b>Role of <code>&lt;s&gt</code> and
    <code>&lt;/s&gt</code>.</b> The distinguished
    <em>beginning-of-sentence</em> and <em>end-of-sentence</em> tokens
    <code>&lt;s&gt</code> and <code>&lt;/s&gt</code> are not in the
    effective vocabulary, and no part of the input speech is decoded
    into either of them.  They are merely anchors at the ends of each
    utterance, and provide context for the LM.  This is in contrast to
    earlier versions of Sphinx, which required some silence at either
    end of each speech utterance, to be decoded into these tokens.
    </P>

    
    
    <H3><A name="sec_dec_tune"><U>Performance Tuning</U></a></H3>
    
    <P>To obtain the best recognition performance, it is necessary to
    select the appropriate front-end and feature type computation,
    train the various models, as well as tune the decoder
    configuration parameters.  This section deals with the last issue.
    There are mainly two groups of parameters to be tuned, pertaining
    to <a href="#sec_tune_prune">pruning</a> and <a
    href="#sec_tune_lw">LM</a>.  Unfortunately, there are no automatic
    methods for determining the values of these parameters; it is
    necessary to derive them by trial and error.  Additionally, the
    following points should be kept in mind with regard to the pruning
    parameters:
    </P>
    <UL>
      <LI>The pruning parameters need to be tuned whenever the
      acoustic model is changed.</LI> <P></P>

      <LI>Changing the LM related parameters affects the effective
      pruning behaviour.  The pruning parameters ought to be re-tuned
      after the former have been tuned (although this step is often
      skipped in practice).</LI> <P></P>

      <LI>For computational efficiency, the beamwidth parameter values
      should be as narrow as possible (values closer to 1.0 are
      narrower), and the absolute pruning parameter values should be
      as small as possible.</LI> <P></P>

      <LI>But, for recognition accuracy, the pruning parameters should
      be as relaxed as possible.  (However, relaxing the beamwidth
      parameters too much can actually <em>worsen</em> recognition
      accuracy.  The reasons for such perverse behaviour are not quite
      understood.)</LI>
    </UL>



    <H4><A name="sec_tune_prune"><U>Tuning the Pruning Behaviour</U></a></H4>

    <P>The pruning parameters are the following:</P>
    <UL>
      <LI><code>-beam</code>: Determines which HMMs remain active at
      any given point (frame) during recognition.  (Based on the best
      state score within each HMM.)
      </LI>

      <LI><code>-pbeam</code>: Determines which active HMM can
      transition to its successor in the lexical tree at any point.
      (Based on the exit state score of the source HMM.)
      </LI>

      <LI><code>-wbeam</code>: Determines which words are recognized
      at any frame during decoding.  (Based on the exit state scores
      of leaf HMMs in the lexical trees.)</LI>

      <LI><code>-maxhmmpf</code>: Determines the number of HMMs
      (approx.) that can remain active at any frame.</LI>

      <LI><code>-maxwpf</code>: Controls the number of distinct words
      recognized at any given frame.</LI>

      <LI><code>-maxhistpf</code>: Controls the number of distinct
      word histories recorded in the backpointer table at any given
      frame.</LI>

      <LI><code>-subvqbeam</code>: For each <a
      href="#sec_am">senone</a> and its underlying acoustic model,
      determines its active mixture components at any frame.</LI>
    </UL>
    
    
    <P>In order to determine the pruning parameter values empirically,
    it is first necessary to obtain a <em>test set</em>,
    <em>i.e.</em>, a collection of test sentences not used in any
    training data.  The test set should be sufficiently large to
    ensure statistically reliable results.  For example, a
    large-vocabulary task might require a test set that includes a
    half-hour of speech, or more.
    </P>
    
    <P>It is difficult to tune a handful of parameters simultaneously,
    especially when the input models are completely new.  The
    following steps may be followed to deal with this complex problem.
    </P>
    <OL>
      <LI>To begin with, set the absolute pruning parameters to large
      values, making them essentially ineffective.  Set both
      <code>-beam</code> and <code>-pbeam</code> to
      <code>1e-60</code>, and <code>-wbeam</code> to
      <code>1e-30</code>.  Set <code>-subvqbeam</code> to a small
      value (e.g., the same as <code>-beam</code>).  Run the decoder
      on the chosen test set and obtain accuracy results.  (Use
      default values for the <a href="#sec_tune_lw">LM related
      parameters</a> when tuning the pruning parameters for the first
      time.)
      </LI>
      <P></P>
    
      <LI>Repeat the decoder runs, varying <code>-beam</code> up and
      down, until the setting for best accuracy is identified.  (Keep
      <code>-pbeam</code> the same as <code>-beam</code> every time.)
      </LI>
      <P></P>
    
      <LI>Now vary <code>-wbeam</code> up and down and identify its
      best possible setting (keeping <code>-beam</code> and
      <code>-pbeam</code> fixed at their most recently obtained
      value).
      </LI>
      <P></P>
    
      <LI>Repeat the above two steps, alternately optimizing
      <code>-beam</code> and <code>-wbeam</code>, until convergence.
      Note that during these iterations <code>-pbeam</code> should
      always be the same as <code>-beam</code>.  (This step can be
      omitted if the accuracy attained after the first iteration is
      acceptable.)
      </LI>
      <P></P>
    
      <LI>Gradually increase <code>-subvqbeam</code> (<em>i.e.</em>,
      towards 1.0 for a narrower setting), stopping when recognition
      accuracy begins to drop noticeably.  Values near the default are
      reasonable.  (This step is needed only if a <a
      href="#am_subvq">sub-vector quantized</a> model is available for
      speeding up acoustic model evaluation.)
      </LI>
      <P></P>
    
      <LI>Now gradually increase <code>-pbeam</code> (<em>i.e.</em>,
      towards 1.0), stopping when recognition accuracy begins to drop
      noticeably.  (This step is optional; it mainly optimizes the
      computational effort a little more.)
      </LI>
      <P></P>
    
      <LI>Reduce <code>-maxhmmpf</code> gradually until accuracy
      begins to be affected.  Repeat the process with
      <code>-maxwpf</code>, and then with <code>-maxhistpf</code>.
      (However, in some situations, especially when the vocabulary
      size is small, it may not be necessary to tune these absolute
      pruning parameters.)
      </LI>
    </OL>

    <P>In practice, it may not always be possible to follow the above
    steps strictly.  For example, considerations of computational cost
    might dictate that the absolute pruning parameters or the
    <code>-subvqbeam</code> parameter be tuned earlier in the
    sequence.

    <P>The parameters needed to be tuned are the following:</P>

    </UL>
    <P>Like the pruning parameters, the above two are tuned on a test
    set.  Since the decoder is much more sensitive to the language

    necessary to repeat the process.

    <P>A pronunciation lexicon (or dictionary) file specifies word
    pronunciations.  In Sphinx, pronunciations are specified as a
    linear sequence of <em>phonemes</em>.  Each line in the file
    contains one pronunciation specification, except that any line
    that begins with a "#" character <u>in the first column</u> is
    treated as a comment and is ignored.  Example dictionary for
    digits:
    </P>
    <pre>
ZERO               Z IH R OW
ONE                W AH N
TWO                T UW

    <P>The lexicon is completely <em>case-insensitive</em>

    Compound word tokens are formed by concatenating the component
    word strings with an underscore character; e.g.:
    </P>

    <pre>WANT_TO           W AA N AX</pre>

    <P>The Sphinx-3 decoders actually need two separate lexicons: a
    "regular" one containing the words in the language of interest,
    and also a <em>filler</em> or <em>noise</em> lexicon.  The latter
    defines "words" not in the language.  More specifically, it
    defines legal "words" that do not appear in the language model
    used by the decoder, but are nevertheless encountered in normal

    <H3><a name="am_intro"><U>Introduction</U></a></H3>

    <P>Sphinx-3 is based on <em>subphonetic acoustic models</em>.
    First, the basic sounds in the language are classified into
    phonemes or <em>phones</em>.  There are roughly 50 phones in the
    English language.  For example, here is a pronunciation for the
    word <code>LANDSAT</code>:
    </P>
    <pre>L  AE  N  D  S  AE  TD</pre>
    
    <P>Phones are then further refined into context-dependent
    <em>triphones</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, phones occurring in given left
    and right phonetic contexts.  The reason is that the same phone
    within different contexts can have widely different acoustic
    manifestations, requiring separate acoustic models.  For example,
    the two occurrences of the <code>AE</code> phone above have
    different contexts, only the first of which is nasal.
    </P>
    
    <P>In contrast to triphones, a phone considered without any
    specific context is referred to as a <em>context-independent</em>
    phone or <em>basephone</em>.  Note also that context-dependency
    gives rise to the notion of <em>cross-word</em> triphones.  That
    is, the left context for the leftmost basephone of a word depends
    on what was the previous word spoken.
    </P>
    
    <P>Phones are also distinguished according to their position
    within the word: beginning, end, internal, or single (abbreviated
    <code>b</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>i</code> and <code>s</code>,
    respectively).  For example, in the word <code>MINIMUM</code> with
    the following pronunciation:
    </P>
    <pre>M IH N AX M AX M</pre> 

    <P>the three occurrences of the phone <code>M</code> have three
    different position attributes.  The <code>s</code> attribute
    applies if a word has just a single phone as its pronunciation.
    </P>
    
    <P>For most applications, one builds acoustic models for
    triphones, qualified by the four position attributes.  (This
    provides far greater modelling detail and accuracy than if one
    relies on just basephone models.)  Each triphone is modelled by a
    <em>hidden Markov model</em> or <em>HMM</em>.  Typically, 3 or 5
    state HMMs are used, where each state has a statistical model for
    its underlying acoustics.  But if we have 50 basephones, with 4
    position qualifiers and 3-state HMMs, we end up with a total of
    50<sup>3</sup>*4*3 distinct HMM states!  Such a model set would be
    too large and impractical to train.  To keep things manageable,
    HMM states are <em>clustered</em> into a much smaller number of
    groups.  Each such group is called a <em>senone</em> (in Sphinx
    terminology), and all the states mapped into one senone share the
    same underlying statistical model.  (The clustering of HMM states
    into senones is described in Mei-Yuh Hwang's PhD Thesis.)
    </P>
    
    <P>Each triphone also has a <em>state transition probability
    matrix</em> that defines the topology of its HMM.  Once again, to
    conserve resources, there is a considerable amount of sharing.
    Typically, there is one such matrix per basephone, and all
    triphones derived from the same parent basephone share its state
    transition matrix.
    </P>
    
    <P>The information regarding triphones and mapping from triphone
    states to senones and transition matrices is captured in a
    <em>model definition</em>, or <em>mdef</em> input file.

    <H3><a name="am_feature"><U>Acoustic Features Computation</U></a></H3>
    
    <P>For various reasons, it is undesirable to build acoustic models
    directly in terms of the raw audio samples.  Instead, the audio is
    processed to extract a vector of relevant features.  All acoustic
    modelling is carried out in terms of such feature vectors.
    </P>
    
    <P>In Sphinx, feature vector computation is a two-stage process.
    An off-line <a href="./s3_fe_spec.pdf"><em>front-end</em></a>
    module is first responsible for processing the raw audio sample
    stream into a <em>cepstral</em> stream, which can then be input to
    the Sphinx software.  The input audio stream consists of 16-bit
    samples, at a sampling rate of 8 or 16 KHz depending on whether
    the input is narrow or wide-band speech.  The input is windowed,
    resulting in <em>frames</em> of duration 25.625 ms. The number of
    samples in a frame depends on the sampling rate. The output is a
    stream of 13-dimensional real-valued <em>cepstrum
    vectors</em>. The frames overlap, thus resulting in a rate of 100
    vectors/sec.
    </P>
    
    <P>In the second stage, the Sphinx software (both trainer and
    decoder) internally converts the stream of cepstrum vectors into a
    <em>feature stream</em>.  This process consists of the following
    steps:
    </P>
    <OL>
      <LI>An optional <em>cepstrum mean-normalization</em> (CMN) step,
      which itself includes an optional <em>variance
      normalization</em> (VN) step.
      </LI>
      <P></P>

      <LI>An optional <em>automatic gain control</em> (AGC) step, in
      which the signal power component of the cepstral vectors is
      normalized.
      </LI>
      <P></P>

      <LI><em>Feature vector generation</em>.  The final speech
      feature vector is created by typically augmenting the cepstrum
      vector (after CMN and AGC, if any) with one or more time
      derivatives.  In s3.X, the feature vector in each frame is
      computed by concatenating first and second derivatives to the
      cepstrum vector, giving a 39-dimensional vector:

    <H3><a name="am_training"><U>Acoustic Model Training</U></a></H3>
    
    <P>This refers to the computation of a (statistical) model for
    each senone in the model.  As a <u>very rough approximation</u>,
    this process can be described by the following <u>conceptual</u>
    steps:
    <P>
    <OL>
      <LI>Obtain a corpus of training data.  This may include
      thousands of sentences (or <em>utterances</em>, in Sphinx
      jargon), consisting of the spoken text and corresponding audio
      sample stream.
      </LI>
      <P></P>
      
      <LI>For each utterance, convert the audio data to a stream of
      feature vectors as described above.
      </LI>
      <P></P>

      <LI>For each utterance, convert the text into a linear sequence
      of triphone HMMs using the <a href="#sec_dict">pronunciation
      lexicon</a>.  (This is usually called the <em>sentence
      HMM</em>.)
      </LI>
      <P></P>

      <LI>For each utterance, find the best <em>state sequence</em> or
      <em>state alignment</em> through the sentence HMM, for the
      corresponding feature vector sequence.  For example, the figure
      below shows a single HMM with 3 states (using senones 0, 1, 2),
      and an utterance of 14-frames of feature vectors.  The figure
      also shows a sample HMM-state (senone) sequence: each feature
      frame is labelled with a senone ID.
	<div class="silverbox">
	  <center><IMG ALT="* " SRC="./s3/falign.gif"></center>
	</div>
      The best state sequence is one with the <em>smallest
      mismatch</em> between the input feature vectors and the labelled
      senones' underlying statistical models.
      </LI>
      <P></P>

      <LI>For each senone, gather all the frames in the training
      corpus that mapped to that senone in the above step, and build a
      suitable statistical model for the corresponding collection of
      feature vectors.
      </LI>
    </OL>
    <P>Note that there is a circularity in the above description.  We
    wish to train the senone models, but in the penultimate step, we
    need the senone models to compute the best possible state
    alignment.  This circularity is resolved by using the iterative
    <em>Baum-Welch</em> or <em>forward-backward</em> training
    algorithm.  The algorithm begins with some initial set of models,
    which could be completely flat, for the senones.  It then repeats
    the last two steps several times.  Each iteration uses the model
    computed at the end of the previous iteration.
    </P>
    
    <P>Although not mentioned above, the HMM state-transition
    probability matrices are also trained from the state alignments.
    Acoustic modelling is described in greater detail in the Sphinx-3
    trainer module.
    </P>
    
    
    <H3><a name="am_struct"><U>Model Structures</U></a></H3>
    
    <P>The acoustic models trained as described above can be of
    different degrees of sophistication.  Two forms are commonly used:
    </P>
    <UL>
      <LI><em>continuous</em>, and
      <LI><em>semi-continuous</em> or <em>tied-mixture</em>.
    </UL>
    <P>In a continuous model, each senone has its own, private
    <em>mixture-Gaussian</em> distribution that describes the
    statistics of its underlying speech feature space.  In a
    semi-continuous model, all the senones share a single
    <em>codebook</em> of Gaussian distributions, but each senone has
    its own set of <em>mixture weights</em> applied to the codebook
    components.  Sphinx-3 supports both models, and other,
    intermediate degrees of state-tying as well.  (The s3.X decoder,
    however, can only handle continuous density acoustic models.)
    </P>
    
    <P>Similarly, Sphinx-3 in general supports "arbitrary" HMM
    topologies, unlike Sphinx-II, which is restricted to a specific
    5-state topology.  However, for efficiency's sake, the s3.X
    decoder is hardwired to deal with only two types of HMM
    topologies: 3-state and 5-state, described briefly in <a
    href="../src/libs3decoder/hmm.h">hmm.h</a>.
    </P>


    <H3><a name="am_subvq"><U>Sub-Vector Quantized Models</U></a></H3>
    
    <P>Continuous density acoustic models are computationally
    expensive to deal with, since they can contain hundreds of
    thousands of Gaussian densities that must be evaluated in each
    frame.  To reduce this cost, one can use an approximate model that
    efficiently identifies the top scoring candidate densities in each
    Gaussian mixture in any given frame.  The remaining densities can
    be ignored during that frame.
    </P>
    
    <P>In Sphinx-3, such an approximate model is built by
    <em>sub-vector quantizing</em> the acoustic model densities.  The
    utility that performs this conversion is included in this
    distribution and is called <code>gausubvq</code>, which stands for
    Gaussian Sub-Vector Quantization.
    </P>
    
    <P>Note that if the original model consists of mixture Gaussians
    that only contain a few component densities (say, 4 or fewer per
    mixture), a sub-vector quantized model may not be effective in
    reducing the computational load.
    </P>

      state transition matrix.
      </LI>
      <LI>Gaussian <em>mean</em> and <em>variance</em> (or

    <H3><a name="lm_intro"><U>Introduction</U></a></H3>

    <P>The main language model (LM) used by the Sphinx decoder is a
    conventional bigram or trigram backoff language model.  The <a
    href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/SLM_info.html"><em>CMU-Cambridge
    SLM toolkit</em></a> is capable of generating such a model from LM
    training data.  Its output is an ascii text file.  But a large
    text LM file can be very slow to load into memory.  To speed up
    this process, the LM must be compiled into a <a
    href="#lm_dumpfile">binary form</a>.  The code to convert from an
    ascii text file to the binary format is available at <a
    href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx">SourceForge</a>
    in the CVS tree, in a module named <em>share</em>.
    </P>
    
    
    <H3><a name="lm_ngrams"><U>Unigrams, Bigrams, Trigrams, LM
    Vocabulary</U></a></H3>

    <P>A trigram LM primarily consists of the following:</P>
    <UL>
      <LI><em>Unigrams:</em> The entire set of words in this LM, and
      their individual probabilities of occurrence in the language.
      The unigrams must include the special
      <em>beginning-of-sentence</em> and <em>end-of-sentence</em>
      tokens: <code>&lt;s&gt</code>, and <code>&lt;/s&gt</code>
      respectively.</LI> <P></P>
    
      <LI><em>Bigrams:</em> A <em>bigram</em> is mathematically
      <em>P(word2 | word1)</em>.  That is, the <em>conditional
      probability</em> that <em>word2</em> immediately follows
      <em>word1</em> in the language.  An LM typically contains this
      information for some subset of the possible word pairs.  That
      is, not all possible <em>word1 word2</em> pairs need be covered
      by the bigrams.</LI> <P></P>
    
      <LI><em>Trigrams:</em> Similar to a bigram, a <em>trigram</em>
      is <em>P(word3 | word1, word2)</em>, or the conditional
      probability that <em>word3</em> immediately follows a <em>word1
      word2</em> sequence in the language.  Not all possible 3-word
      combinations need be covered by the trigrams.</LI> <P></P>
    </UL>
    <P>The <em>vocabulary</em> of the LM is the set of words covered
    by the unigrams.</P> 

    <P>The LM probability of an entire sentence is the product of the
    individual word probabilities.  For example, the LM probability of
    the sentence <code>"HOW ARE YOU"</code> is:</P>

    <pre>
P(HOW | &lt;s&gt) * 
P(ARE | &lt;s&gt, HOW) * 
P(YOU | HOW, ARE) * 
P(&lt;/s&gt | ARE, YOU)</pre>


    
    <H3><a name="lm_pron_case"><U>Pronunciation and Case
    Considerations</U></a></H3>

    <P>In Sphinx, the LM cannot distinguish between different
    pronunciations of the same word.  For example, even though the
    lexicon might contain two different pronunciation entries for the
    word <code>READ</code> (present and past tense forms), the
    language model cannot distinguish between the two.  Both
    pronunciations would inherit the same probability from the
    language model.
    </P>
    
    <P>Secondly, the LM is <em>case-insensitive</em>.  For example, it
    cannot contain two different tokens <code>READ</code> and
    <code>read</code>.
    </P>

    <P>The reasons for the above restrictions are historical.  Precise
    pronunciation and case information has rarely been present in LM
    training data.  It would certainly be desirable to do away with
    the restrictions at some time in the future.
    </P>

    
    
    <H3><a name="lm_dumpfile"><U>Binary LM File</U></a></H3>
    
    <P>The binary LM file (also referred to as the LM <em>dump</em>
    file) is more or less a disk image of the LM data structure
    constructed in memory.  This data structure was originally
    designed during the Sphinx-II days, when efficient memory usage
    was the focus.  In Sphinx-3, however, memory usage is no longer an
    issue since the binary file enables the decoder to use a
    <em>disk-based LM</em> strategy.  That is, the LM binary file is
    no longer read entirely into memory.  Rather, the portions
    required during decoding are read in on demand, and cached.  For
    large vocabulary recognition, the memory resident portion is
    typically about 10-20% of the bigrams, and 5-10% of the trigrams.
    </P>

    <P>Since the decoder uses a <a href="#lm_dumpfile">disk-based
    LM</a>, it is necessary to have efficient access to the binary LM
    file.  Thus, network access to an LM file at a remote location is
    not recommended.  It is desirable to have the LM file be resident
    on the local machine.
    </P>
      
    <P>The binary dump file can be created from the ascii form using
    the <code>lm3g2dmp</code> utility, which is part of the Sphinx-II
    distribution, and also available as standalone code, as mentioned
    before.  (The header of the dump file itself contains a brief
    description of the file format.)
    </P>
    

    
    <H3><a name="lm_filler"><U>Silence and Filler Words</U></a></H3>

    <P>Language models typically do not cover acoustically significant
    events such as silence, breath-noise, <em>UM</em> or <em>UH</em>
    sounds made by a person hunting for the right phrase, etc.  These
    are known generally as <em>filler words</em>, and are excluded
    from the LM vocabulary.  The reason is that a language model
    training corpus, which is simply a lot of text, usually does not
    include such information.
    </P>
    
    <P>Since the main trigram LM ignores silence and filler words,
    their "language model probability" has to be specified in a
    separate file, called the <em>filler penalty file</em>.  The
    format of this file is very straightforward; each line contains
    one word and its probability, as in the following example:
    </P>
    <pre>
++UH++      0.10792
++UM++      0.00866
++BREATH++  0.00147</pre>

    <P>The filler penalty file is not required.  If it <em>is</em>
    present, it does not have to contain entries for every filler
    word.  The decoder allows a default value to be specified for
    filler word probabilities (through the <code>-fillprob</code>
    configuration argument), and a default silence word probability
    (through the <code>-silprob</code> argument).
    </P>
    
    <P>Like the main trigram LM, filler and silence word probabilities
    are obtained from appropriate training data.  However, training
    them is considerably easier since they are merely unigram
    probabilities.
    </P>

    <P>Filler words are invisible or <em>transparent</em> to the
    trigram language model.  For example, the LM probability of the
    sentence <code>"HAVE CAR &lt;sil&gt WILL TRAVEL"</code> is:</P>
    <pre>
P(HAVE | &lt;s&gt) * 
P(CAR | &lt;s&gt, HAVE) * 
P(&lt;sil&gt) *
P(WILL | HAVE, CAR) * 
P(TRAVEL | CAR, WILL) * 
P(&lt;/s&gt | WILL, TRAVEL)</pre>


    
    <H3><a name="lm_lw_wip"><U>Language Weight and Word Insertion
    Penalty</U></a></H3>
    
    <P>During recognition the decoder combines both acoustic
    likelihoods and language model probabilities into a single score
    in order to compare various hypotheses.  This combination of the
    two is not just a straightforward product.  In order to obtain
    optimal recognition accuracy, it is usually necessary to
    <em>exponentiate</em> the language model probability using a
    <em>language weight</em> before combining the result with the
    acoustic likelihood.  (Since likelihood computations are actually
    carried out in the log-domain in the Sphinx decoder, the LM weight
    becomes a multiplicative factor applied to LM log-probabilities.)
    </P>
    
    <P>The language weight parameter is typically obtained through
    trial and error.  In the case of Sphinx, the optimum value for
    this parameter has usually ranged between 6 and 13, depending on
    the task at hand.
    </P>
    
    <P>Similarly, though with lesser impact, it has also been found
    useful to include a <em>word insertion penalty</em> parameter
    which is a fixed penalty for each new word hypothesized by the
    decoder.  It is effectively another multiplicative factor in the
    language model probability computation (before the application of
    the language weight).  This parameter has usually ranged between
    0.2 and 0.7, depending on the task.

    <H2><a name="sec_ctl"><U>Speech Input Control File</U></a></H2>
    
    <P>The Sphinx-3 decoder processes entries listed in a <em>control
    file</em>.  Each line in the control file identifies a separate
    <em>utterance</em>.  A line has the following format (the brackets
    indicate a group of fields that is optional):
    </P>
    <pre>
AudioFile [ StartFrame EndFrame UttID ]</pre>

    <P><em>AudioFile</em> is the speech input file. In this
    distribution of s3.X, this file is in raw audio format. In all
    other versions of Sphinx-3, this file contains cepstrum data.  The
    filename extension should be omitted from the specification.  If
    this is the only field in the line, the entire file is processed
    as one utterance.  In this case, an <em>utterance ID</em> string
    is automatically derived from the cepstrum filename, by stripping
    any leading directory name components from it.  E.g.: if the
    control file contains the following entries:
    </P>
    <pre>
/net/alf20/usr/rkm/SHARED/cep/nov94/h1_et_94/4t0/4t0c0201
/net/alf20/usr/rkm/SHARED/cep/nov94/h1_et_94/4t0/4t0c0202
/net/alf20/usr/rkm/SHARED/cep/nov94/h1_et_94/4t0/4t0c0203</pre>

    <P>three utterances are processed, with IDs <code>4t0c0201</code>,
    <code>4t0c0202</code>, and <code>4t0c0203</code>, respectively.
    </P>
    
    <P>If, on the other hand, a control file entry includes the
    <em>StartFrame</em> and <em>EndFrame</em> fields, only that
    portion of the cepstrum file is processed.  This form of the
    control file is frequently used if the speech input can be
    arbitrarily long, such as an entire TV news show.  There is one
    big cepstrum file, but it is processed in smaller chunks or
    segments.  In this case, the final <em>UttID</em> field is the
    utterance ID string for the entry.
    </P>
    
    <P>The utterance ID associated with a control file entry is used
    to identify all the output from the decoder for that utterance.
    For example, if the decoder is used to generate <a
    href="#sec_wordlat">word lattice</a> files, they are named using
    the utterance ID.  Hence, each ID, whether automatically derived
    or explicitly specified, should be unique over the entire control
    file.
    </P>

    <P>Any line in the control file beginning with a <code>#</code>
    character is a comment line, and is ignored.

    <P>The Sphinx-3 decoder produces a single recognition
    <em>hypothesis</em> for each utterance it processes.  The
    hypotheses for all the utterances processed in a single run are
    written to a single output file, one line per utterance.  The line
    format is as follows:

    <pre><em>u</em> S <em>s</em> T <em>t</em> A <em>a</em> L <em>l</em> <em>sf</em> <em>wa</em> <em>wl</em> <em>wd</em> <em>sf</em> <em>wa</em> <em>sl</em> <em>wd</em> ... <em>nf</em></pre>

    <P>The <code>S</code>, <code>T</code>, <code>A</code>, and
    <code>L</code> fields are keywords and appear in the output as
    shown.  The remaining fields are briefly described below:
    </P>
    <UL>
      <LI><em>u</em>: the utterance ID

      <LI><em>s</em>: an acoustic score scaling done during acoustic
      likelihood computation (However, this field is 0 in the s3.X
      decoder output.)

      <LI><em>t</em>: the total score for this hypothesis

      <LI><em>a</em>: the total acoustic score for this hypothesis

      <LI><em>l</em>: the total language model score for this hypothesis
    </UL>
    <P>The <em>l score</em> field is followed by groups of four fields,
    one group for each successive word in the output hypothesis.  The
    four fields are:
    </P>
    <UL>
      <LI><em>sf</em>: Start frame for the word (its end frame is just
      before the start frame of the next word)

      <LI><em>wa</em>: Acoustic score for the word

      <LI><em>wl</em>: LM score for the word

      <LI><em>wd</em>: The word string itself.
    </UL>
    <P>The final field, <em>nf</em>, in each hypothesis line is the
    total number of frames in the utterance.</P>
    
    <P>Note that all scores are <em>log-likelihood</em> values in the
    peculiar logbase used by the decoder.  Secondly, the acoustic
    scores are <em>scaled</em> values; in each frame, the acoustic

    <h3><a name="wordlat_overview"><U>Word Lattice Overview</U></a></H3>
    
    <P>During recognition the decoder maintains not just the single
    best hypothesis, but also a number of alternatives or candidates.
    For example, <code>REED</code> is a perfectly reasonable
    alternative to <code>READ</code>.  The alternatives are useful in
    many ways: for instance, in N-best list generation.  To facilitate
    such <em>post-processing</em>, the decoder can optionally produce
    a <em>word lattice</em> output for each input utterance.  This
    output records all the candidate words recognized by the decoder
    at any point in time, and their main attributes such as time
    segmentation and acoustic likelihood scores.
    </P>
    
    <P>The term "lattice" is used somewhat loosely.  The word-lattice
    is really a <em>directed acyclic graph</em> or <em>DAG</em>.  Each
    node of the DAG denotes a word instance that begins at a
    particular frame within the utterance.  That is, it is a unique
    <code>&lt;word,start-time&gt</code> pair.  (However, there could
    be a number of end-times for this word instance.  One of the
    features of a time-synchronous Viterbi search using beam pruning
    is that word candidates hypothesized by the decoder have a
    well-defined start-time, but a fuzzy range of end-times.  This is
    because the start-time is primarily determined by <em>Viterbi
    pruning</em>, while the possible end-times are determined by beam
    pruning.)
    </P>
    
    <P>There is a directed edge between two nodes in the DAG if the
    start-time of the destination node immediately follows one of the
    end times of the source node.  That is, the two nodes can be
    adjacent in time.  Thus, the edge determines one possible
    segmentation for the source node: beginning at the source's
    start-time and ending one frame before the destination's
    start-time.  The edge also contains an acoustic likelihood for
    this particular segmentation of the source node.
    </P>
    
    <P><em>Note:</em> The beginning and end of sentence tokens,
    <code>&lt;s&gt</code> and <code>&lt;/s&gt</code>, are not decoded
    as part of an utterance by the s3.X decoder.  However, they have
    to be included in the word lattice file, for compatibility with
    the older Sphinx-3 decoder software.  They are assigned 1-frame
    segmentations, with log-likelihood scores of 0.  To accommodate
    them, the segmentations of adjacent nodes have to be "fudged" by 1
    frame.
    </P>



    <h3><a name="wordlat_format"><U>Word Lattice File Format</U></a></H3>

    <P>A word lattice file essentially contains the above information
    regarding the nodes and edges in the DAG.  It is structured in
    several sections, as follows:
    </P>
    <OL>
      <LI>A comment section, listing important configuration arguments
      as comments</LI>
     
      <LI><code>Frames</code> section, specifying the number of frames
      in utterance</LI>

      <LI><code>Nodes</code> section, listing the nodes in the DAG</LI>

      <LI><code>Initial</code> and <code>Final</code> nodes (for
      <code>&lt;s&gt</code> and <code>&lt;/s&gt</code>,
      respectively)</LI>

      <LI><code>BestSegAscr</code> section, a historical remnant now
      essentially empty</LI>

      <LI><code>Edges</code> section, listing the edges in the DAG</LI>
    </OL>
    
    <P>The file is formatted as follows.  Note that any line in the
    file that begins with the <code>#</code> character in the first
    column is considered to be a comment.
