-in align, astar and dag, it was optionally, but now it is compulsory.

livepretend's -samprate change to 16000
ep had no filter bank type (-fbtype) and no seed setter (-seed)
Also changed name -srate to -samprate. 
We need to put -mach_endian (we couldn't because of macro), -whichchan and -nchans into the macro

common_search_beams_command_line_macro() 
allphone used -wip = 0.7
-noisepen becomes -fillpen, the default from 0.05 to 0.1
dag used -wip = 0.65 now becomes 0.7
changed -noisepen to -fillprob the default changed from 0.05 to 0.1

Change the default of control_file_handling_command_line_macro to
1000000000, both are quite reasonable but thew new one seems to be
more closed to the max. 

hypothesis_file_handling_command_line_macro()
astar needs to change the -match to -hyp

output_lattice_handling_command_line_macro() shared by
decode/ld/lp/da. da needs to take care of generation -outlatoldfmt.

-utt is deleted in live_pretend

-change mach_endian to machine_endian in main_ep and wave2feat
