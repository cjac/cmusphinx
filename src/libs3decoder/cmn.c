 * HISTORY
 * 
 * 20.Apr.2001  RAH (rhoughton@mediasite.com, ricky.houghton@cs.cmu.edu)
 *              Added cmn_free() and moved *mean and *var out global space and named them cmn_mean and cmn_var
 * 
 * 28-Apr-1999	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Changed the name norm_mean() to cmn().
 * 
 * 19-Jun-1996	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Changed to compute CMN over ALL dimensions of cep instead of 1..12.
 * 
 * 04-Nov-1995	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
