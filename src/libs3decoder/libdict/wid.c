 * $Log: wid.c,v $
 * Revision 1.8  2006/02/22 21:07:29  arthchan2003
 * Merged from branch SPHINX3_5_2_RCI_IRII_BRANCH: add LTS to wid.c.  Please read the comment in revision 1.6 of dict.c
 *
 * Revision 1.7.4.2  2005/10/17 04:48:45  arthchan2003
 * Free resource correctly in dict2pid.
 *
 * Revision 1.7.4.1  2005/09/25 19:15:34  arthchan2003
 * When there is OOV and -ltsoov is 1, then apply the built-in TTS rule.  If the phone set generated by the LTS or the phone set used by mdef mismatches.  The code will stop the recognizer completely. This ensure not stupid things happen in decoding.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2005/06/21 21:05:49  arthchan2003
 * 1, Fixed doxygen documentation, 2, Added  keyword.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/03/30 01:08:38  archan
 * codebase-wide update. Performed an age-old trick: Adding $Log into all .c and .h files. This will make sure the commit message be preprended into a file.
 *
 * 26-Feb-2004  A Chan (archan@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *              Add information to correctly take care class id.
