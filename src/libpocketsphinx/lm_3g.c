/* 
 *
 * lm_3g.c -- Darpa Trigram LM module.
 *
 * HISTORY
 * 
 * 28-Oct-98	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added lm3g_access_type() and necessary support.
 * 
 * 15-Oct-98	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Bugfix: inclass_ugscore[lw3] changed to inclass_ugscore[w3] in
 * 		lm3g_tg_score().  (Thanks to dbansal@cs.)
 * 
 * 15-Jul-98	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Corrected references to unigram_t.wid to unigram_t.mapid.
 * 
 * 14-Apr-98	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added lm3g_n_lm() and lm3g_index2name().
 * 
 * 03-Apr-97	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added lm3g_raw_score() and lm_t.invlw.
 * 		Changed a number of function names from lm_... to lm3g_...
 * 
 * 09-Jan-97	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		BUGFIX: Added check for lmp->unigrams[i].wid in lm_set_current().
 * 
 * 06-Dec-95	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Changed function name lmname_to_lm() to lm_name2lm().
 * 
 * 06-Dec-95	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Changed function name get_current_lm to lm_get_current.
 * 		Changed check for already existing word in lm_add_word, and added
 * 		condition to updating dictwid_map.
 * 
 * 01-Jul-95	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Removed LM cache and replaced with find_bg and find_tg within the main
 * 		bigrams and trigram structures.  No loss of speed and uses less memory.
 * 
 * 24-Jun-95	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Fixed a number of memory leaks while deleting an LM.  Added the global
 * 		dictwid_map, and allocated it once and never freed.  Made sure lm_cache
 * 		is created only once.
 * 
 * 14-Jun-95	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Modified lm_read to return 0 on success, and to delete any existing LM
 * 		with the new LM name (instead of reporting error and exiting).
 * 		Added backslash option in building filenames (for PC compatibility).
 *
 * Revision 8.9  94/10/11  12:36:28  rkm
 * Changed lm_tg_score to call lm_bg_score if no trigrams present or
 * the first word is invalid.
 * 
 * Revision 8.8  94/07/29  11:54:23  rkm
 * Renamed lmSetParameters to lm_set_param and moved it into lm_add().
 * Added functions lm_init_oov() to create initial list of OOVs,
 * and lm_add_word() to add new OOV at run time.
 * 
 * Revision 8.7  94/05/19  14:19:59  rkm
 * Rewrote LM cache code for greater efficiency.
 * 
 * Revision 8.6  94/05/10  10:47:58  rkm
 * Added lm_add() and lm_set_param() functions, for dynamically adding a new
 * in-memory LM to the set of available LMs.
 * 
 * Revision 8.5  94/04/22  13:53:27  rkm
 * Added query_lm_cache_lines() to allow run-time spec of #cache lines.
 * 
 * Revision 8.4  94/04/14  15:08:46  rkm
 * Added function lm_delete() to delete a named LM and reclaim space.
 * 
 * Revision 8.3  94/04/14  14:40:27  rkm
 * Minor changes.
 * 
 * Revision 8.1  94/02/15  15:09:22  rkm
 * Derived from v7.  Includes multiple LMs for grammar switching.
 * 
 * Revision 6.13  94/02/11  13:14:45  rkm
 * Added bigram and trigram multi-line caches, and functions, for v7.
 * Replaced sequential search in wstr2wid() with hash_lookup().
 * 
 * Revision 6.12  94/01/07  10:56:16  rkm
 * Corrected bug relating to input file format.
 * 
 * Revision 6.11  93/12/17  13:14:52  rkm
 * *** empty log message ***
 * 
 * Revision 6.10  93/12/03  17:09:59  rkm
 * Added ability to handle bigram-only dump files.
 * Added <s> </s> bigram -> MIN_PROB.
 * Added timestamp to dump files.
 * 
 * Revision 6.9  93/12/01  12:29:55  rkm
 * Added ability to handle LM files containing only bigrams.
 * Excluded start_sym from interpolation of unigram prob with uniform prob.
 * 
 * 
 * 93/10/21 rkm@cs.cmu.edu
 * Added <c.h>
 * 
 * Revision 6.6  93/10/19  18:58:10  rkm
 * Added code to change bigram-prob(<s>,<s>) to very low value.  The
 * Darpa LM file contains a spurious value to be ignored.
 * Fixed bug that dumps one trigram entry too many.
 * 
 * Revision 6.5  93/10/15  15:00:14  rkm
 * 
 * Revision 6.4  93/10/13  16:56:04  rkm
 * Added LM cache line stats.
 * Added bg_only option for lm_read parameter list
 * (but not yet implemented).
 * Changed proc name ilm_LOG_prob_of to lm3g_prob, to avoid conflict
 * with Roni's ILM function of the same name.
 * 
 * Revision 6.3  93/10/09  17:01:55  rkm
 * M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon
 * Cleaned up handling precompiled binary 3g LM file,
 * Added SWAP option for HP platforms.
 * 
 * Revision 6.2  93/10/06  11:08:15  rkm
 * M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * Darpa Trigram LM module.  Created.
