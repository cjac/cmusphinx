/*
 * longword I/O routines
 * 
 * Created October 11, 1989 by Joe Keane.
 * 
 * These routines read and write longwords in a machine-independent format:
 * four bytes, most significant first.  On the Sun this is the same as the
 * internal format, so these routines can use fread and fwrite.  The routines
 * return negative result on error, except for read_long, where the caller
 * has to check for errors.
