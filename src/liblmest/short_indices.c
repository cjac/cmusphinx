  HISTORY
  $Log: short_indices.c,v $
  Revision 1.4  2006/06/19 21:02:07  archan
  Changed license from the original research-only license to the BSD license.

  Revision 1.3  2006/04/13 17:33:26  archan
  0, This particular change enable 32bit LM creation in ARPA format.  1, rationalized/messed up the data type, (Careful, with reading and writing for 8-byte data structure, they are not exactly working at this point.) 2, all switches in idngram2lm is changed to be implemented by the disc_meth object.

  Revision 1.2  2006/04/02 23:50:28  archan
  Indented, changed styles, removed junks.

/* Procedures to allow the indices which point into the next table to
   be stored as two-byte integers, rather than four byte integers. 

   All that is stored of the indices are two bytes corresponding to
   the offset. For each table, we also store an array indicating where
   the non-offset part increases (which we can do, since the indices
   will be monotonically increasing).
   
  This is probably best illustrated with an example. Suppose our array
  contains the following:

  ind_table[0]=0
  ind_table[1]=30
  ind_table[2]=73
  
  and the stored indices are called index[0..100]. Then the actual
  indices are

  actual_index[0..29] = (0*key) + index[0..29]
  actual_index[30..72] = (1*key) + index[30..72]
  actual_index[73..100] = (2*key) + index[73..100]
