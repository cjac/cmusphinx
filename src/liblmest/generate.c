  generate.c : A sentence generation routine originally built by

  HISTORY 
  $Log: generate.c,v $
  Revision 1.1  2006/04/15 20:59:59  archan
  Added Arthur Toth's n-gram based sentence generator to evallm.  Arthur has given me a very strong precaution to use the code.  So, I will also make sure the current version will only be used by a few.

/*
  Comments from Arthur Chan 

  The initial check-in also lack of the capability of dealing with
  potentially more than 4 bil words. Of course, this is more a
  theoretical issue.

/* generate_words implements the "generate" command in the evallm command loop.

   It can take the following flags (yes, I know I should add this to the help
   text in evallm.c):
   -text filename    The name of the file where text will be generated.
   -size 10000       An optional flag specifying the number of generated words.
                     If unspecified, it will default to 10000.
   -seed 1237688     An optional flag specifying a seed for the random number
                     generator.  If unspecified, it will be set to the time in
                     seconds since the epoch.

   Caveats:
   1) It currently only works for binary language model files.

   2) It currently assumes the language model is a trigram, although it 
   probably wouldn't take much effort to make it more general.

   3) When generating the first word, it currently tries to use an initial 
   history of "<s> <s>" if "<s>" is in the vocabulary and just picks the word 
   at index 1 otherwise.  Something better could probably be done in this case
   (e.g. looking for other context cue words in the vocab list).

   4) Certain platforms appear to use something other than RAND_MAX for the
   maximum number that can be generated by random().  This could cause strange
   things to happen, but could be fixed very easily by replacing RAND_MAX by
   the appropriate platform-specific constant.
