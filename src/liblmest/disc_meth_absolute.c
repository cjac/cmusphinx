 * HISTORY
 * $Log: disc_meth_absolute.c,v $
 * Revision 1.3  2006/04/13 17:33:26  archan
 * 0, This particular change enable 32bit LM creation in ARPA format.  1, rationalized/messed up the data type, (Careful, with reading and writing for 8-byte data structure, they are not exactly working at this point.) 2, all switches in idngram2lm is changed to be implemented by the disc_meth object.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2006/04/02 23:53:39  archan
 * Implemented all methods on different discounting.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2006/03/31 04:10:18  archan
 * Start to add a class for smoothing methods.  Only one method is implemented. In the Project L's case, we probably want to mix C-class and switch for a while.
