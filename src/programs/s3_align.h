 * HISTORY
 * 
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.9  2006/03/28  04:50:14  dhdfu
 * Add an option to control the insertion of optional silences and filler
 * words (the TTS people may want to use this, and I need it)
 * 
 * Revision 1.8  2006/02/24 18:30:20  arthchan2003
 * Changed back s3senid to int32.  Don't know the reason why using s3senid_t will cause failure in test. Need to talk with Dave.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2006/02/24 16:42:48  arthchan2003
 * Fixed function prototype for align_sen_active
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2006/02/24 04:42:32  arthchan2003
 * Merged from branch SPHINX3_5_2_RCI_IRII_BRANCH: Fixed dox-doc.
 *
 * Revision 1.5.4.2  2005/08/02 21:42:34  arthchan2003
 * 1, Moved static variables from function level to the application level. 2, united all initialization of HMM using s3_am_init, 3 united all GMM computation using ms_cont_mgau_frame_eval.
 *
 * Revision 1.5.4.1  2005/07/22 03:46:56  arthchan2003
 * 1, cleaned up the code, 2, fixed dox-doc. 3, use srch.c version of log_hypstr and log_hyp_detailed.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2005/06/22 05:39:56  arthchan2003
 * Synchronize argument with decode. Removed silwid, startwid and finishwid.  Wrapped up logs3_init, Wrapped up lmset. Refactor with functions in dag.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2005/03/24 15:24:01  archan
 * I found Evandro's suggestion is quite right after yelling at him 2 days later. So I decide to check this in again without any binaries. (I have done make distcheck. ) . Again, this is a candidate for s3.6 and I believe I need to work out 4-5 intermediate steps before I can complete the first prototype.  That's why I keep local copies. 
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2004/12/06 11:31:48  arthchan2003
 * Fix brief comments for programs.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2004/12/05 12:01:32  arthchan2003
 * 1, move libutil/libutil.h to s3types.h, seems to me not very nice to have it in every files. 2, Remove warning messages of main_align.c 3, Remove warning messages in chgCase.c
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/09/13 08:13:28  arthchan2003
 * update copyright notice from 200x to 2004
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/08/30 22:29:19  arthchan2003
 * Refactor the s3.0 tools, currently it is still quite messy, we need to make it modularize later on.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/08/09 00:17:12  arthchan2003
 * Incorporating s3.0 align, at this point, there are still some small problems in align but they don't hurt. For example, the score doesn't match with s3.0 and the output will have problem if files are piped to /dev/null/. I think we can go for it.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/02/14 14:40:34  cbq
 * Compiles.  Analysis is probably hosed.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2000/04/24 09:39:41  lenzo
 * s3 import.
 *
 * 
 * 13-Sep-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Changed align_sen_active to flag active senones instead of building a list
 * 		of them.
 * 
 * 15-Jul-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Created.
