  $Log: binlm2arpa.c,v $
  Revision 1.5  2006/06/19 21:02:08  archan
  Changed license from the original research-only license to the BSD license.

  Revision 1.4  2006/04/13 17:36:37  archan
  0, This particular change enable 32bit LM creation in ARPA format.  Binary reading and writing are more complicated issues.  I will try to use the next 3 days to tackle them.  1, idngram2lm has been significantly rewritten. We start to see the most important 150 lines in LM counting code. (line 676 to 833 in v1.9)
