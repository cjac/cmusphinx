 * HISTORY
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.15  2006/02/24  04:40:53  arthchan2003
 * Merged from the branch SPHINX3_5_2_RCI_IRII_BRANCH: Used ctl_process from now on.
 * 
 * Revision 1.14.4.3  2006/01/16 20:29:52  arthchan2003
 * Changed -ltsoov to -lts_mismatch. Changed lm_rawscore interface. Change from cmd_ln_access to cmd_ln_str.
 *
 * Revision 1.14.4.2  2005/07/27 23:23:39  arthchan2003
 * Removed process_ctl in allphone, dag, decode_anytopo and astar. They were duplicated with ctl_process and make Dave and my lives very miserable.  Now all application will provided their own utt_decode style function and will pass ctl_process.  In that way, the mechanism of reading would not be repeated. livepretend also follow the same mechanism now.  align is still not yet finished because it read yet another thing which has not been considered : transcription.
 *
 * Revision 1.14.4.1  2005/07/18 23:21:24  arthchan2003
 * Tied command-line arguments with marcos
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2005/06/22 05:39:56  arthchan2003
 * Synchronize argument with decode. Removed silwid, startwid and finishwid.  Wrapped up logs3_init, Wrapped up lmset. Refactor with functions in dag.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2005/06/15 21:41:56  archan
 * Sphinx3 to s3.generic: 1) added -ctloffset and -ctlcount support for livepretend. 2) Also allow lmname to be set correctly.  Now it is using ld_set_lm instead of kb_setlm.  That makes the code cleaner.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2005/04/20 03:50:36  archan
 * Add comments on all mains for preparation of factoring the command-line.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2005/03/30 00:43:41  archan
