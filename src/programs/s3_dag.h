 * HISTORY
 * 
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.6  2005/06/22  05:39:56  arthchan2003
 * Synchronize argument with decode. Removed silwid, startwid and finishwid.  Wrapped up logs3_init, Wrapped up lmset. Refactor with functions in dag.
 * 
 * Revision 1.3  2005/06/03 06:45:30  archan
 * 1, Fixed compilation of dag_destroy, dag_dump and dag_build. 2, Changed RARG to REQARG.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2005/03/24 15:24:01  archan
 * I found Evandro's suggestion is quite right after yelling at him 2 days later. So I decide to check this in again without any binaries. (I have done make distcheck. ) . Again, this is a candidate for s3.6 and I believe I need to work out 4-5 intermediate steps before I can complete the first prototype.  That's why I keep local copies. 
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2004/12/14 00:50:33  arthchan2003
 * 1, Change the code to accept extension, 2, add timer to livepretend, 3, fixing the s3_astar to separate the bypass variable to bypass and is_filler_bypass.  4, Add some doxygen comments. 5, Don't care about changes in main_decode_anytopo.c. It is still under work, 6, remove option -help and -example from 3.5 releases.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2004/12/06 11:31:48  arthchan2003
 * Fix brief comments for programs.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2004/12/05 12:01:32  arthchan2003
 * 1, move libutil/libutil.h to s3types.h, seems to me not very nice to have it in every files. 2, Remove warning messages of main_align.c 3, Remove warning messages in chgCase.c
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/09/13 08:13:28  arthchan2003
 * update copyright notice from 200x to 2004
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/08/30 22:29:19  arthchan2003
 * Refactor the s3.0 tools, currently it is still quite messy, we need to make it modularize later on.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/08/09 00:17:12  arthchan2003
 * Incorporating s3.0 align, at this point, there are still some small problems in align but they don't hurt. For example, the score doesn't match with s3.0 and the output will have problem if files are piped to /dev/null/. I think we can go for it.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/02/14 14:40:34  cbq
 * Compiles.  Analysis is probably hosed.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2000/04/24 09:39:41  lenzo
 * s3 import.
 *
 * 
 * 13-Sep-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Changed align_sen_active to flag active senones instead of building a list
 * 		of them.
 * 
 * 15-Jul-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Created.
