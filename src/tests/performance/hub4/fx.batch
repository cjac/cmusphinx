/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.492.fx.raw  i think there is very much a strong feeling here that crisis is what it is and it may be one of the most serious crises everybody one meets in the street a lot of the u. n. officials who are still here say this is in if anything graver than the situation we were in at the beginning of the year because this time instead of rejecting the inspectors over something like the investigation of presidential sites these places that the iraqi's originally would not let the inspectors go this time we have got a rejection of the whole process and that is going to be a much much harder thing to fix
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.494.fx.raw  yes technically the nuclear and the missile file and the chemical file are not as yet wound up but the biological one is certainly the one that is causing the most problems but what the u. n. inspectors have been saying is oh just give us a little bit more detail and then you know round the corner will come the time when we can end the process and lift sanctions and the iraqis say well we have heard that again and again and now we are told you got to do this little bit more a little bit more more evidence more documents and at the same time the u. n. accusing them of not being honest with them about various things and they say well to hell with it we will not do this because it is not going to happen we are not going to get what we want so we are going to try and find another way
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.496.fx.raw  well i think they have got a lot of allies on the security council as well as in the region here who feel that the french the chinese and the russians on the security council are certainly suggested that they have sympathy with that view and i think in the region here even their old enemy iran seems to be taking a a rather more liberal view of things and perhaps that might be one area where they could actually suspend sanctions unilaterally if you like just restart trade with iran with syria perhaps also with jordan and just get on with it and say well we do not recognize sanctions

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.512.fx.raw  the fungus has been found on the skin of some of dying frogs in just the last year or so it is not known whether this fungus is actually the cause of death for certain and but it is certainly is very exciting and promising the problem is that we cannot jump to the conclusion that as the cause of death and nor have can we then even make a much greater leap and say that it is actually the cause of the declines on a global scale
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.514.fx.raw  i i think it is very unlikely we have been had frogs missing in australia now since 1979 and many scientists around the world have been working on the problem if it was a simple answer then i think we would have hopefully found it a long time ago what we think is that frogs suffering from what we call immuno depression which means that they are not able to cope with normal diseases or infections like a fungus that they would have coped within the past and because of that then it has got to be something maybe even on a global scale something like global warming something like increased u. v. radiation all of these types of pressures which obviously have a human source weaken the frogs and therefore make them more susceptible to what otherwise might have been an acquired natural disease
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.516.fx.raw  well it is certainly the catch cries that we have been hearing is that the frogs may be the canary in the coal mine i think it is a good analogy i think if we find in australia for example we have seven species that have disappeared entirely and who is going to disappear next if it was something like the koala or the grizzly bear in north america then people would be screaming and yelling and they would be very much fearing for their own lives especially when it is mysterious these frogs are disappearing in relatively undisturbed areas they are in in australia in the core of large national parks
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.518.fx.raw  well one of the most interesting frogs in the world was the gastric brooding frog in australia where the female ate the eggs and the tadpoles developed inside her stomach
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.520.fx.raw  somehow she produced chemicals in her stomach which stopped her from digesting her own tadpoles and her own babies now that chemical could have been extremely important for humans trying to solve the problem of stomach ulcers and so there was great potential for that particular species of frog to make a valuable contribution to medical science for humans it is hard to pinpoint the the value of something like a frog but it is certainly i think just inherent in its own right that it is a species on the planet as i am said earlier i guess like a grizzly bear or the bald eagle if we lose these species then we have lost a very part of our own heritage and our and our own life itself
