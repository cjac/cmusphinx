HAVE YOU D-  (dvd7_Bro022_chan0_me018_c1_149.003_149.596)
I WAS JUST GONNA ASK DO YOU WANT TO SAY ANY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT OR  (dvd7_Bro022_chan0_me018_c1_150.050_153.513)
OH UH A LITTLE BIT ABOUT  (dvd7_Bro022_chan5_me006_c1_153.520_156.050)
MMM  (dvd7_Bro022_chan0_me018_c1_153.948_154.410)
WH- WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE GONNA YOU SAID YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE UH PARTICULAR FEATURES THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT OR  (dvd7_Bro022_chan0_me018_c1_155.350_160.110)
OH THE THE RIGHT WELL I WAS UM  (dvd7_Bro022_chan5_me006_c1_157.913_162.355)
I THINK ONE OF THE PERPLEXING PROBLEMS IS UM  (dvd7_Bro022_chan5_me006_c1_163.245_167.339)
FOR A WHILE I WAS THINKING THAT I HAD TO COME UP WITH A COMPLETE SET OF INTERMEDIATE FEATURES IN- INTERMEDIATE CATEGORIES TO TO CLASSIFY RIGHT AWAY  (dvd7_Bro022_chan5_me006_c1_167.339_176.381)
++MICROPHONE_NOISE++  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_172.597_173.329)
BUT WHAT I'M THINKING NOW IS I WOULD START WITH WITH A REASONABLE SET SOMETHING SOMETHING LIKE UM UM  (dvd7_Bro022_chan5_me006_c1_176.381_185.361)
LIKE UH RE- REGULAR PHONETIC FEATURES JUST TO JUST TO START OFF THAT WAY  (dvd7_Bro022_chan5_me006_c1_185.840_190.073)
AND DO SOME PHONE RECOGNITION UM BUILD A SYSTEM THAT UH CLASSIFIES THESE UM THESE FEAT- UH THESE INTERMEDIATE CATEGORIES USING UH MULTI BAND TECHNIQUES  (dvd7_Bro022_chan5_me006_c1_190.073_203.919)
COMBINE THEM AND DO  ++GARBAGE++  ++GARBAGE++ RECOGNITION  (dvd7_Bro022_chan5_me006_c1_204.690_207.934)
LOOK AT THEN I WOULD LOOK AT THE ERRORS PRODUCED IN THE  ++GARBAGE++ RECOGNITION AND SAY O. K. WELL I COULD PROBABLY REDUCE THE ERRORS IF I INCLUDED THIS EXTRA FEATURE OR THIS EXTRA INTERMEDIATE CATEGORY  (dvd7_Bro022_chan5_me006_c1_208.270_220.370)
THAT WOULD THAT WOULD REDUCE CERTAIN CONFUSIONS OVER OTHER CONFUSIONS  (dvd7_Bro022_chan5_me006_c1_220.654_224.761)
++MOUTH_NOISE++ AND THEN AND THEN ++BREATH++ REITERATE  (dvd7_Bro022_chan5_me006_c1_225.355_228.706)
UM BUILD THE INTERMEDIATE  ++GARBAGE++ UH DO  ++GARBAGE++ RECOGNITION LOOK AT THE ERRORS AND THEN POSTULATE NEW OR REMOVE UM INTERMEDIATE CATEGORIES AND THEN DO IT AGAIN  (dvd7_Bro022_chan5_me006_c1_228.706_242.032)
SO YOU'RE GONNA USE  ++GARBAGE++  (dvd7_Bro022_chan0_me018_c1_242.120_243.430)
UM FOR THAT FOR THAT PART OF THE THE PROCESS YEAH I WOULD USE  ++GARBAGE++  (dvd7_Bro022_chan5_me006_c1_243.260_247.435)
MM HMM  (dvd7_Bro022_chan0_me018_c1_246.504_247.064)

++MICROPHONE_NOISE++  (dvd7_Bro022_chanB_mn052_s1_267.230_269.080)

OH O. K. SURE SO UM LAST WEEK I FINALLY GOT RESULTS FROM THE S. R. I. SYSTEM ABOUT THIS MEAN SUBTRACTION APPROACH  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_345.010_353.582)
AND UM WE WE GOT AN IMPROVEMENT UH IN WORD ERROR RATE TRAINING ON THE T. I. DIGITS DATA SET AND TESTING ON MEETING RECORDER DIGITS OF UM  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_354.507_364.582)

ON THE FAR MIKE DATA <sil> USING P. Z. M. F. BUT UM THE NEAR MIKE PERFORMANCE WORSENED UM FROM ONE POINT TWO PERCENT TO TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_369.115_381.317)
AND UM  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_382.029_383.222)
WH- WHY WOULD THAT BE UM ++BREATH++  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_384.449_387.031)
CONSIDERING THAT WE ACTUALLY GOT AN IMPROVEMENT IN NEAR MIKE PERFORMANCE USING H. T. K. AND SO  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_387.031_391.343)
++BREATH++ UH WITH SOME INPUT FROM UH ANDREAS I HAVE A THEORY IN TWO PARTS UM  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_391.343_395.605)
++MICROPHONE_NOISE++  (dvd7_Bro022_chanB_mn052_s1_393.251_393.686)
++BREATH++  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_395.605_396.486)
FIRST OF ALL H. T. K. SORRY S. R- THE S. R. I. SYSTEM IS DOING CHANNEL ADAPTATION AND SO H. T. K. WASN'T UM SO THIS UM  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_396.486_405.409)
THIS MEAN SUBTRACTION APPROACH WILL DO A KIND OF CHANNEL <sil> NORMALIZATION AND SO THAT MIGHT HAVE GIVEN THE H. T. K. USE OF IT A BOOST THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN APPLIED IN THE S. R. I. CASE  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_406.230_413.825)
++BREATH++ AND ALSO UM THE ANDREAS POINTED OUT THE S. R. I. SYSTEM IS USING MORE PARAMETERS IT'S GOT FINER GRAINED ACOUSTIC MODELS  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_413.825_422.973)
SO THOSE FINER GRAINED ACOUSTIC MODELS COULD BE MORE SENSITIVE TO THE ARTIFACTS <sil> IN THE RE SYNTHESIZED AUDIO  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_422.973_428.610)
++BREATH++ UM  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_428.610_430.272)
AND ME AND BARRY WERE LISTENING TO THE RE SYNTHESIZED AUDIO AND SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE YOU GET OF A BIT OF AN ECHO OF SPEECH  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_431.397_437.292)
IN THE BACKGROUND AND SO THAT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE DIFFICULT FOR TRAINING CUZ YOU COULD HAVE <sil> DIFFERENT PHONES <sil> LINED UP WITH A DIFFERENT FOREGROUND PHONE  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_437.292_447.063)
++BREATH++ UM ++BREATH++  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_447.063_448.797)
DEPENDING ON <sil> THE TIMING OF THE ECHO SO UM  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_448.797_452.338)
++BREATH++ I'M GONNA TRY TRAINING ON A LARGER DATA SET AND THEN EH THE SYSTEM WILL HAVE SEEN MORE EXAMPLES O- OF THESE ARTIFACTS AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE MORE ROBUST TO THEM  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_452.338_461.298)
++BREATH++ SO I'M PLANNING TO USE THE  ++GARBAGE++  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_461.298_463.429)
SET OF UM READ SPEECH AND UM HMM  (dvd7_Bro022_chan4_me026_s1_463.890_468.599)
++BREATH++ I HAD ANOTHER THOUGHT JUST NOW WHICH IS UH REMEMBER WE WERE TALKING BEFORE ABOUT  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_468.304_473.400)
WE WERE TALKING IN OUR MEETING ABOUT UH THIS STUFF THAT  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_473.400_476.816)
SOME OF THE OTHER STUFF THAT AVENDANO DID WHERE THEY WERE  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_476.816_479.665)
UM GETTING RID OF LOW ENERGY <sil> SECTIONS  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_479.665_483.351)
UM UH IF YOU  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_483.351_486.170)
IF YOU DID A HIGH PASS FILTERING AS HIRSCH DID IN <sil> LATE EIGHTIES TO REDUCE SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF REVERBERATION  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_486.170_493.623)
UH UH AVENDANO AND  ++GARBAGE++ WERE ARGUING THAT  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_493.623_497.424)
UH PERHAPS ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT WORKING WAS MA- MAY NOT HAVE EVEN BEEN THE FILTERING SO MUCH BUT THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU FILTER A  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_497.424_504.755)
AN ALL POSITIVE POWER SPECTRUM YOU GET SOME NEGATIVE VALUES  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_504.755_508.879)
AND YOU GOTTA FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THEM IF ++GARBAGE++ GONNA CONTINUE TREATING THIS AS A POWER SPECTRUM  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_508.879_513.122)
SO WHAT WHAT HIRSCH DID WAS UH SET THEM TO ZERO SET THE NEGATIVE VALUES TO ZERO  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_513.122_518.561)
SO IF YOU IMAGINE A A WAVEFORM THAT'S ALL POSITIVE  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_518.561_521.851)
WHICH IS THE TIME TRAJECTORY OF ENERGY  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_521.851_525.007)
UM AND UH SHIFTING IT DOWNWARDS  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_525.007_528.467)
AND THEN GETTING RID OF THE NEGATIVE PARTS  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_528.467_530.171)
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY THROWING AWAY THE LOW ENERGY THINGS  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_530.171_532.509)
AND IT'S THE LOW ENERGY PARTS OF THE SPEECH  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_532.509_534.967)
WHERE THE REVERBERATION IS MOST AUDIBLE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE REVERBERATION FROM HIGHER ENERGY THINGS SHOWING UP IN  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_534.967_540.665)
SO IN THIS CASE YOU HAVE SOME ARTIFICIALLY IMPOSED <sil> REVERBERATION LIKE THING I MEAN YOU'RE GETTING RID OF  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_540.665_546.217)
SOME OF THE OTHER EFFECTS OF REVERBERATION  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_546.217_548.237)
BUT BECAUSE YOU HAVE THESE NON CAUSAL WINDOWS  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_548.237_551.231)
YOU'RE GETTING THESE FUNNY THINGS COMING IN UH AT N-  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_551.231_554.416)
AND UM WHAT IF YOU DID  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_554.416_557.575)
I MEAN THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY THAT THE THE PROCESSING FOR THIS RE SYNTHESIS HAS TO BE RESTRICTED  (dvd7_Bro022_chan1_me013_s1_557.575_562.158)
