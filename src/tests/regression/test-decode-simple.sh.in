# (README BEFORE YOU CHANGE THIS TEST) ARCHAN: 
# This is perhaps the most important test for the decoder because the argument specified
# is the smallest set that one could use the decoder. 
#
# If your change happened to break this test and what you will need is to **augment** argument
# to this test.  That is to say what you did is not conform to the design of the recognizer. 
# Please re-consider before you apply your change. 
#
# Why the current set is the minimal? Consider this.  An hmm-based speech recognizer essentially
# just required 4 information to start the decoder. 
# 1, The waveform input.
# 2, The graph which could be an LM or an FSG. 
# 3, The dictionary. 
# 4, The HMM. 
#
# So, the 6 arguments we used are already too many. :-)
# The answer fo the code is not the P I T T S B U R G H. It will be P I T G S B U R G H
