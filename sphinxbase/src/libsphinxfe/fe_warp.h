 * Revision 1.2  2006/02/17 00:31:34  egouvea
 * Removed switch -melwarp. Changed the default for window length to
 * 0.025625 from 0.256 (so that a window at 16kHz sampling rate has
 * exactly 410 samples). Cleaned up include's. Replaced some E_FATAL()
 * with E_WARN() and return.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2006/02/16 00:18:26  egouvea
 * Implemented flexible warping function. The user can specify at run
 * time which of several shapes they want to use. Currently implemented
 * are an affine function (y = ax + b), an inverse linear (y = a/x) and a
 * piecewise linear (y = ax, up to a frequency F, and then it "breaks" so
 * Nyquist frequency matches in both scales.
 *
 * Added two switches, -warp_type and -warp_params. The first specifies
 * the type, which valid values:
 *
 * -inverse or inverse_linear
 * -linear or affine
 * -piecewise or piecewise_linear
 *
 * The inverse_linear is the same as implemented by EHT. The -mel_warp
 * switch was kept for compatibility (maybe remove it in the
 * future?). The code is compatible with EHT's changes: cepstra created
 * from code after his changes should be the same as now. Scripts that
 * worked with his changes should work now without changes. Tested a few
 * cases, same results.
