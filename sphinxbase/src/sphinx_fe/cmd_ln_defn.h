 * $Log: cmd_ln_defn.h,v $
 * Revision 1.7  2006/02/25 00:53:48  egouvea
 * Added the flag "-seed". If dither is being used and the seed is less
 * than zero, the random number generator is initialized with time(). If
 * it is at least zero, it's initialized with the provided seed. This way
 * we have the benefit of having dither, and the benefit of being
 * repeatable.
 *
 * This is consistent with what sphinx3 does. Well, almost. The random
 * number generator is still what the compiler provides.
 *
 * Also, moved fe_init_params to fe_interface.c, so one can initialize a
 * variable of type param_t with meaningful values.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2006/02/17 00:31:34  egouvea
 * Removed switch -melwarp. Changed the default for window length to
 * 0.025625 from 0.256 (so that a window at 16kHz sampling rate has
 * exactly 410 samples). Cleaned up include's. Replaced some E_FATAL()
 * with E_WARN() and return.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2006/02/16 00:18:26  egouvea
 * Implemented flexible warping function. The user can specify at run
 * time which of several shapes they want to use. Currently implemented
 * are an affine function (y = ax + b), an inverse linear (y = a/x) and a
 * piecewise linear (y = ax, up to a frequency F, and then it "breaks" so
 * Nyquist frequency matches in both scales.
 *
 * Added two switches, -warp_type and -warp_params. The first specifies
 * the type, which valid values:
 *
 * -inverse or inverse_linear
 * -linear or affine
 * -piecewise or piecewise_linear
 *
 * The inverse_linear is the same as implemented by EHT. The -mel_warp
 * switch was kept for compatibility (maybe remove it in the
 * future?). The code is compatible with EHT's changes: cepstra created
 * from code after his changes should be the same as now. Scripts that
 * worked with his changes should work now without changes. Tested a few
 * cases, same results.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2006/02/14 20:56:54  eht
 * Implement an argument -melwarp that changes the standard mel-scale
 * equation from:
 *      M(f) = 2595 * log10( 1 + f/700 )
 * to:
 *      M(f,w) = 2595 * log10( 1 + f/(700*w))
 *
 * So, 1.0 means no warp,  w > 1.0 means linear compression w < 1.0 means
 * linear expansion.
 *
 * Implement argument -nskip and -runlen arguments so that a subset of the
 * utterances in the control file can be executed.  Allows a simple
 * distribution of wave2feat processing over N processors.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2005/05/19 21:21:55  egouvea
 * Bug #1176394: example bug
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/11/23 04:14:06  egouvea
 * Fixed bug in cmd_ln.c in which a wrong boolean argument led into an
 * infinite loop, and fixed the help and example strings, getting rid of
 * spaces, so that the appearance is better.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/09/09 17:59:30  egouvea
 * Adding missing files to wave2feat
