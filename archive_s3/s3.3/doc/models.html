<p>Note: This file must be read by anyone who intends to use the
models in this package for recognition. The specifications provided
here must be exactly matched in the user's setup to prevent 
recognition failures.</p>

<p>The models have been trained using 140 hours of 1996 and 1997 hub4
training data, available from the <a
href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu">Language Data Consortium</a>. The
phoneset for which models have been provided is that of the <a
href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict">CMU dictionary</a>
version 0.6d.  The dictionary has been used without stress markers,
resulting in 40 phones, including the silence phone, SIL. Adding
stress markers degrades performance by about 5% relative.</p>

<p>The models have been trained with Mel-frequency cepstra (MFC) vectors
derived from the hub4 data. Each vector is composed of 13 cepstral 
coefficients, 13 delta cepstra and 13 double delta cepstra. Each vector
is thus 39-dimensional. The correct SPHINX name for the vectors used
is "1s_c_d_dd", and this must be specified to the decoder(s) for correct
usage of the acoustic models provided. The specifications for the
feature set are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>premphasis factor = 0.970</li>
      <li>sampling rate = 16000.000 Hz</li>
      <li>frame rate = 100.000 frames/sec</li>
      <li>Hamming window length = 0.0256 sec</li>
      <li>size of FFT = 512 samples</li>
      <li>number of Mel filters = 40</li>
      <li>lower edge of filter bank = 133.33334 Hz</li>
      <li>upper edge of filter bank = 6855.49756 Hz</li>
      <li>number of MFCC coefficients/frame = 13</li>
      <li>dither = added</li>
      <li>feature type = "1s_c_d_dd"</li>
    </ul>

<p> The models are 3-state within-word and cross-word triphone HMMs
with no skips permitted between states.  There is one set of models in
this package, comprised of 6000 senones. Other sets are or will soon
be available from the <a href="http://cmusphinx.org">CMU Open Source
Sphinx</a> web page. A set of quantized models have also been provided with
the set of models. The models have 8 Gaussians per state, and the quantized models use 4096 codewords. </p>

<p>The quantized models are for use with s3.2/3.3 (<em>fast
decoder</em>), which also requires the corresponding un-quantized
models during runtime (<em>ie</em>, both must be provided). The
quantized models are labeled as .quant and are placed in the same
subdirectory as the corresponding full model.</p>

<p>The un-quantized models can be used with the s3 continuous decoder
(<em>slow decoder</em>).</p>

<p>The language model in this distribution is provided as an example
of use and test for the installation, and is not meant to be used with
any serious task. It is a flat unigram language model for CMU's <a
href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/databases/an4/">Census</a>
database. The dictionary, also provided, is restricted to the letters
of the alphabet and some additional control words.</p>

<p>Another language model, provided through the Sphinx web page
referred above, , a simple trigram model, and which has been built for
tasks similar to broadcast news, is or will soon be available from the
Sphinx web page refered above. You are strongly encouraged to get this
language models if you intend serious applications. The text used to
build this model was taken from a variety of permitted sources,
including broadcast news. The vocabulary covers 64000 words, and is
listed in the file called language_model.vocabulary.  The file
language_model.arpaformat.gz can be used with the Sphinx-2 decoder,
while the file language_model.arpaformat.DMP.Z must be used with the
Sphinx-3 decoders. Note that the system will only recognize words
which are within the vocabulary. See a description of the <a
href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sphinxman/fr7.html">ARPA
format</a>.</p>
