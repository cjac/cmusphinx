Sphinx-4 is a speech recognition system written entirely in the
Java(TM) programming language.

<p>
The diagram below shows the general architecture of Sphinx-4, followed by
a description of each block:

<br><i>Figure 1: Architecture diagram of Sphinx-4.</i>

<p>

<b><a href="edu/cmu/sphinx/recognizer/Recognizer.html">Recognizer</a></b> - Contains the main components of Sphinx-4, which are
the front end, the linguist, and the decoder. The application interacts
with the Sphinx-4 system mainly via the Recognizer.

<p>
<b>Audio</b> - The data to be decoded. This is audio in most systems,
but it can also be configured to accept other forms of data,
e.g., spectral or cepstral data.


<p>
<b><a href="edu/cmu/sphinx/frontend/FrontEnd.html">Front End</a></b> - Performs digital signal processing (DSP) on the incoming data.


<p>
<b>Feature</b> - The output of the front end are features, 
which are used for decoding in the rest of the system.


<p>
<b><a href="edu/cmu/sphinx/linguist/Linguist.html">Linguist</a></b> - Embodies the linguistic knowledge of the system, which are
the acoustic model, the dictionary, and the language model.
The linguist produces a search graph structure on which the search manager
performs search using different algorithms.

<p>
<b><a href="edu/cmu/sphinx/linguist/acoustic/AcousticModel.html">Acoustic Model</a></b> - Contains a representation (often statistical) of a sound, often created by training using lots of acoustic data.

<p>
<b><a href="edu/cmu/sphinx/linguist/dictionary/Dictionary.html">Dictionary</a></b> - Responsible for determining how a words is pronounced.

<p>
<b><a href="edu/cmu/sphinx/linguist/language/ngram/LanguageModel.html">Language Model</a></b> - Contains a representation (often statistical) of the probability of occurrence of words.

<p>
<b><a href="edu/cmu/sphinx/linguist/SearchGraph.html">Search Graph</a></b> - The graph structure produced by the linguist according
to certain criteria (e.g., the grammar), using knowledge from the dictionary,
the acoustic model, and the language model.


<p>
<b><a href="edu/cmu/sphinx/decoder/Decoder.html">Decoder</a></b> - Contains the search manager.


<p>
<b><a href="edu/cmu/sphinx/decoder/search/SearchManager.html">Search Manager</a></b> - Performs search using certain algorithm used, e.g.,
breadth-first search, best-first search, depth-first search, etc.. Also contains the feature scorer and the pruner.



<p>
<b><a href="edu/cmu/sphinx/decoder/search/ActiveList.html">Active List</a></b> - A list of tokens representing all the states in the
search graph that are active in the current feature frame.


<p>
<b><a href="edu/cmu/sphinx/decoder/scorer/AcousticScorer.html">Scorer</a></b> - Scores the current feature frame against all the active
states in the ActiveList.


<p>
<b><a href="edu/cmu/sphinx/decoder/pruner/Pruner.html">Pruner</a></b> - Prunes the active list according to certain strategies.


<p>
<b><a href="edu/cmu/sphinx/result/Result.html">Result</a></b> - The decoded result, which usually contains the N-best results.


<p>
<b><a href="edu/cmu/sphinx/util/props/ConfigurationManager.html">Configuration Manager</a></b> - loads the Sphinx-4 configuration data from an XML-based file, and manages the component life cycle for objects.
