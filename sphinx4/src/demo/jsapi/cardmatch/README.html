</p>

<p>
To run CardMatch, first make sure that all sources are built 
by typing at the top level directory:
</p>

<pre>
ant
</pre>

<p>
To play the game without endpointing (that is, you press the "Speak" 
button to speak and press it again to stop), type the following at the 
<code>demo/jsapi/cardmatch</code> directory:
</p>

<pre>
ant run
</pre>

<p>
To play the game with endpointing (that is, you press the "Speak" button to
speak only), type the following at the <code>demo/jsapi/cardmatch</code>
directory:
</p>

<pre>
ant run-ep
</pre>

<p>
If you are running Linux and have problems with the audio,
please read the 
<a href="../../../index.html#demos_faq">Demo Troubleshooting</a> section.
</p>

<p>
<b>How To Play</b>
</p>

<p>
Throughout the game, you say "card one", "card two", ... "card six" to choose
which card to flip over. If you flip two cards that are the same, those will
stay flipped. Otherwise, they will be covered again. When you match all the
pairs of cards, you win! To start a new game at any point,
say "start a new game".
