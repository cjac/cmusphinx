Provides a set of interfaces and classes that are used to define the
search graph used by the decoder. Implementations of the
<code>Linguist</code> interface are used by the decoder to create the
search graph.  The search graph is a directed graph formed by
<code>SearchState</code> and <code>SearchStateArc</code> objects.
Some implementations of the <code>Linguist</code> may build the search
graph based upon a <code>Grammar</code>, which represents a graph of
words and probabilities.  This package provides a number of different
implementations of <code>Grammar</code>
