/**
 * <p>
 * Computes confidences for a Result.
 * Typically, one is interested in the confidence of the best path
 * of a result, as well as the confidence of each word in the best path
 * of a result. To obtain this information, one should do the following:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * ConfidenceScorer scorer = (ConfidenceScorer) ... // obtain scorer from configuration manager
 *
 * Result result = recognizer.recognize();
 * ConfidenceResult confidenceResult = scorer.score(result);
 *
 * // confidence for best path
 * Path bestPath = confidenceResult.getBestHypothesis();
 * double pathConfidence = bestPath.getConfidence();
 *
 * // confidence for each word in best path
 * WordResult[] words = bestPath.getWords();
 * for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
 *     WordResult wordResult = (WordResult) words[i];
 *     double wordConfidence = wordResult.getConfidence();
 * }
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that different ConfidenceScorers have different definitions for
 * the 'best path', and therefore their <code>getBestHypothesis</code> methods
 * will return different things. The
 * {@link edu.cmu.sphinx.result.MAPConfidenceScorer} returns the highest
 * scoring path. On the other hand, the
 * {@link edu.cmu.sphinx.result.SausageMaker} returns the path where
 * all the words have the highest confidence in their corresponding time slot. 
 * </p>
