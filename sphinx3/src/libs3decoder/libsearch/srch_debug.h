   \file srch_debug.h
   \brief implementation of search debug mode. 
   
   ARCHAN 20050510: An empty search structure. Only used for
   debugging.  Debug mode implementation is useful when programmers
   just want to test out a logic change in srch.c but do not want to
   waste the time in running actual decoding.
