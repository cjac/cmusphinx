 * 
 * HISTORY
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.11.4.2  2005/07/26  02:20:39  arthchan2003
 * merged hyp_t with srch_hyp_t.
 * 
 * Revision 1.11.4.1  2005/07/04 07:25:22  arthchan2003
 * Added vithist_entry_display and vh_lmstate_display in vithist.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2005/06/22 02:47:35  arthchan2003
 * 1, Added reporting flag for vithist_init. 2, Added a flag to allow using words other than silence to be the last word for backtracing. 3, Fixed doxygen documentation. 4, Add  keyword.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2005/06/16 04:59:10  archan
 * Sphinx3 to s3.generic, a gentle-refactored version of Dave's change in senone scale.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2005/06/13 04:02:59  archan
 * Fixed most doxygen-style documentation under libs3decoder.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2005/05/26 00:46:59  archan
 * Added functionalities that such that <sil> will not be inserted at the end of the utterance.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2005/04/25 23:53:35  archan
 * 1, Some minor modification of vithist_t, vithist_rescore can now support optional LM rescoring, vithist also has its own reporting routine. A new argument -lmrescore is also added in decode and livepretend.  This can switch on and off the rescoring procedure. 2, I am reaching the final difficulty of mode 5 implementation.  That is, to implement an algorithm which dynamically decide which tree copies should be entered.  However, stuffs like score propagation in the leave nodes and non-leaves nodes are already done. 3, As briefly mentioned in 2, implementation of rescoring , which used to happened at leave nodes are now separated. The current implementation is not the most clever one. Wish I have time to change it before check-in to the canonical.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2005/04/21 23:50:26  archan
 * Some more refactoring on the how reporting of structures inside kbcore_t is done, it is now 50% nice. Also added class-based LM test case into test-decode.sh.in.  At this moment, everything in search mode 5 is already done.  It is time to test the idea whether the search can really be used.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2005/04/20 03:46:30  archan
 * factor dag header writer into vithist.[ch], do the corresponding change for lm_t
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2005/03/30 01:22:47  archan
 * Fixed mistakes in last updates. Add
 *
 * 
 * 20.Apr.2001  RAH (rhoughton@mediasite.com, ricky.houghton@cs.cmu.edu)
 *              Added vithist_free() to free allocated memory
 * 
 * 30-Sep-1999	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *		Added vithist_entry_t.ascr.
 * 
 * 13-Aug-1999	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added maxwpf handling.
 * 
 * 24-May-1999	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Started.
