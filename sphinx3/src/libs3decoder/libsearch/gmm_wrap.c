/* gmm_wrap.c
 * HISTORY
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1.4.1  2005/07/24  01:35:41  arthchan2003
 * Add a wrapper for computing senone score without computing composite senone score. Mainly used in mode FSG now
 * 
 * Revision 1.1  2005/06/21 22:48:14  arthchan2003
 * A wrapper that provide the function pointer interface of approx_cont_mgau_ci_eval  and approx_cont_mgau_frame_eval.  They are used in srch_gmm_compute_lv1  and srch_gmm_compute_lv2 respectively.  This will also be the home of other gmm computation routine. (Say the s3.0 version of GMM computation)
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2005/06/16 04:59:10  archan
 * Sphinx3 to s3.generic, a gentle-refactored version of Dave's change in senone scale.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/06/11 06:57:50  archan
 * 1, Add senscalre for gmm_wrap.c
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/04/22 04:22:37  archan
 * Add gmm_wrap, this will share code across op_mode 4 and op_mode 5. Also it also separate active senone selection into a different process.  I hope this is the final step before making the WST search works.  At the current stage, the code of mode-5 looks very much alike mode-4.  This is intended because in Prototype 4, tail sharing will be used to reduce memory.
