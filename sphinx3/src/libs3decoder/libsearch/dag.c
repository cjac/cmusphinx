 * HISTORY
 * 
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1.4.2  2005/07/26  02:20:39  arthchan2003
 * merged hyp_t with srch_hyp_t.
 * 
 * Revision 1.1.4.1  2005/07/17 05:44:30  arthchan2003
 * Added dag_write_header so that DAG header writer could be shared between 3.x and 3.0. However, because the backtrack pointer structure is different in 3.x and 3.0. The DAG writer still can't be shared yet.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/06/21 22:37:47  arthchan2003
 * Build a stand-alone wrapper for direct acyclic graph, it is now shared across dag/astar and decode_anytopo.  This eliminate about 500 lines of code in decode_anytopo/dag and astar. However, its existence still can't exterminate code duplication between dag/decode_anytopo.  That effectively means we have many refactoring to do.  Things that are still pretty difficult to merge include dag_search(decode_anytopo/dag) and dag_read (dag/astar).
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/06/03 06:45:28  archan
 * 1, Fixed compilation of dag_destroy, dag_dump and dag_build. 2, Changed RARG to REQARG.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/06/03 05:46:19  archan
 * Refactoring across dag/astar/decode_anytopo.  Code is not fully tested.
 * There are several changes I have done to refactor the code across
 * dag/astar/decode_anyptop.  A new library called dag.c is now created
 * to include all routines that are shared by the three applications that
 * required graph operations.
 * 1, dag_link is now shared between dag and decode_anytopo. Unfortunately, astar was using a slightly different version of dag_link.  At this point, I could only rename astar'dag_link to be astar_dag_link.
 * 2, dag_update_link is shared by both dag and decode_anytopo.
 * 3, hyp_free is now shared by misc.c, dag and decode_anytopo
 * 4, filler_word will not exist anymore, dict_filler_word was used instead.
 * 5, dag_param_read were shared by both dag and astar.
 * 6, dag_destroy are now shared by dag/astar/decode_anytopo.  Though for some reasons, even the function was not called properly, it is still compiled in linux.  There must be something wrong at this point.
 * 7, dag_bestpath and dag_backtrack are now shared by dag and decode_anytopo. One important thing to notice here is that decode_anytopo's version of the two functions actually multiply the LM score or filler penalty by the language weight.  At this point, s3_dag is always using lwf=1.
 * 8, dag_chk_linkscr is shared by dag and decode_anytopo.
 * 9, decode_anytopo nows supports another three options -maxedge, -maxlmop and -maxlpf.  Their usage is similar to what one could find dag.
 *
 * Notice that the code of the best path search in dag and that of 2-nd
 * stage of decode_anytopo could still have some differences.  It could
 * be the subtle difference of handling of the option -fudge.  I am yet
 * to know what the true cause is.
 *
 * Some other small changes include
 * -removal of startwid and finishwid asstatic variables in s3_dag.c.  dict.c now hide these two variables.
 *
 * There are functions I want to merge but I couldn't and it will be
 * important to say the reasons.
 * i, dag_remove_filler_nodes.  The version in dag and decode_anytopo
 * work slightly differently. The decode_anytopo's one attached a dummy
 * predecessor after removal of the filler nodes.
 * ii, dag_search.(s3dag_dag_search and s3flat_fwd_dag_search)  The handling of fudge is differetn. Also, decode_anytopo's one  now depend on variable lattice.
 * iii, dag_load, (s3dag_dag_load and s3astar_dag_load) astar and dag seems to work in a slightly different, one required removal of arcs, one required bypass the arcs.  Don't understand them yet.
 * iv, dag_dump, it depends on the variable lattice.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/03/30 00:43:41  archan
 *
 * 28-Jul-04    ARCHAN at Carnegie Mellon Unversity
 *              First adapted from s3.              
 * 
 * 08-Sep-97	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added .Z compression option to lattice files.
 * 
 * 04-Jun-97	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added dag_chk_linkscr().
 * 
 * 22-Nov-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Implemented -maxedge argument to control memory usage.
 * 
 * 21-Nov-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added -maxlmop and -maxlpf options to abort utterance if exceeded.
 * 
 * 08-Nov-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added exact reporting of word sequence and scores from dag_search.
 * 		For this, added daglink_t.bypass, daglink_t.lscr, daglink_t.src, and
 * 		added bypass argument to dag_link and dag_bypass_link, and changed
 * 		dag_backtrace to find exact best path.
 * 
 * 05-Nov-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added -dagfudge and -min_endfr parameter handling.
 * 
 * 03-Sep-96	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Started.
