/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_1.35.f1.raw  i fear the symbolism of that visit to tiananmen square where nine years ago students were murdered will overwhelm everything else he does
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_1.36.f4.raw  and to other critics this trip itself is being made for the wrong reasons
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_1.37.f1.raw  this is about profits for some large multinational companies at the expense of most products made in america at the expense of our national values

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_1.381.f2.raw  good morning on that social security situation i think first of all people do not realize a lot of people who go out and invest do not understand the markets very well one fifty per cent of all stocks in this country is owned by one per cent of the population before you start trying to turn it so the average individual will go out there and invest their social security money but they ought to first of all just get by the year two thousand and the y. two k. problem which many people feel was going to definitely bring the world into a terrible recession so let us say if we get by that then you people when you see the markets drop tremendously especially since a lot of stocks are selling right now at twenty times the earnings of the company which is pretty high some stocks are selling at fifty times yearly earnings of the company and if to me there is one factor that i have never heard anyone bring up that i think is interesting way that you should take the social security money and invest it and get a better return a lot of in a lot of firms in across the country they have real estate trusts that have done rather well the majority of the profits are made go back to the stock holders take the federal buildings across the country and maybe some rented federal lands and sell that at fair market value to the social security administration the social security administration will then form a real estate trust the american government people owning and through social security a lot of the government buildings and things across the country not the white house and not the congress of course they would then charge rent fair market value rent to the government and other companies for this property property their monies will come back into the government and be used to pay social security and they will probably get a much higher return than basically buying federal bonds

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.392.f0.raw  and it is likely that independent counsel ken starr has been informed law enforcement sources say that in a memo

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.397.f4.raw  so he would have to be willing to comply if such a request were made some legal analysts say it is in starr's interest to keep the results whatever they are under wraps until the president testifies
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.398.f1.raw  you want to keep them off balance you want to have the high ground and you want to be in control of the questioning process the less information the other side has the more likely you are to maintain that line of authority

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.404.f0.raw  sources say the appeals court ruled judge johnson can investigate leaks but taking the president's attorney out of the mix makes it a less threatening prospect for ken starr charlie

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.406.f0.raw  as we said the president has two more weeks to mull over what he will testify to the grand jury will he take back his claim that he had no sexual relationship with monica lewinsky a virtual chorus of politicians and pundits are now saying perhaps he should a. b. c.'s sam donaldson is at the white house sam
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.407.f4.raw  charlie it is really amazing how so many people some of them supporters of the president are suggesting mr clinton may want to revise his story in what amounts to a public confession
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.408.f0.raw  particularly amazing since as far as we know the president is still insisting he is told the truth all along the president's former white house chief of staff leon panetta said today mr
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.409.f4.raw  clinton needs
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.410.f0.raw  to speak up in any case
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.411.fx.raw  i think it is very important that the president share whatever testimony he gives with the american people
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.412.f0.raw  that following yesterday's pronouncement by senator orrin hatch a republican that if the president has lied

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.414.f0.raw  culpa now might save him
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.415.f4.raw  depending on how the president handles it he might be able to resolve these difficulties and might be able to survive it
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.416.f0.raw  with
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.417.f4.raw  polls showing no appetite for impeachment even if the president has lied republicans like hatch realize they will pay a price if they have to move against this popular president in the view of democratic pollster bob shrum
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.418.f1.raw  the country wants this to stop even today a plurality of people in the polling do not want the president to even explain this
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.419.f0.raw  but if a presidential mea culpa might help republicans

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.421.f1.raw  i think his situation is something like that of a fox caught in the hunter's trap there may be a way that the fox can get out of the trap but only if he is willing to chew his own leg off
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.422.f4.raw  of course all this may be academic the president went about his business today plugging away for a summer jobs program with no plans for a speech to the nation and with no change in his story that he had no sexual relationship with monica lewinsky
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.423.f4.raw  according to his press spokesman barry toyve
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.424.f1.raw  he has already spoken to that
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.425.f0.raw  which causes some clinton loyalists like

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.428.f1.raw  you are all going to be terribly disappointed if the president's saying the truth
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.429.f0.raw  many of those who believe the president has not told the truth but can save himself by coming clean now say he has to speak to the nation before he testifies to the grand jury otherwise it might appear that he is been caught there and they emphasize charlie that if he does come forward in this manner mr clinton has to be prepared to tell it all holding back nothing no matter how embarrassing it may be
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.430.f0.raw  all right sam donaldson thanks very much

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.489.f0.raw  with the united nations weapons inspectors appeared to grind to a halt president saddam hussein and the iraqi parliament have called for the suspension of all cooperation with the u. n. team iraq is angry that the inspectors refused to declare that iraq is eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction the head of the u. n. team richard butler cut short his talks with iraqi leaders but he insists the situation has not reached a crisis the b. b. c.'s roger herring in baghdad says saddam hussein's action will lose him no support at home
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.490.fx.raw  i think there is quite a strong popular feeling here at the moment against the u. n. and to some extent against the americans who they see as being behind a lot of what has been going on there is a feeling here they do not want anymore of these sanctions they have had enough of it and there does not seem to be a way out of it through the normal means they have tried hard they claim to prove they do not have weapons of mass destruction anymore as far as they are concerned the u. n. turns around and says no i am sorry we want more detail every time again and again
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.491.f1.raw  richard butler the u. n. mediator in this and the head of the u. n. inspectors is insisting that the situation is not a crisis is that a feeling that basically the iraqi parliament and the iraqi president share or are they a little bit more upset than that
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.492.fx.raw  i think there is very much a strong feeling here that crisis is what it is and it may be one of the most serious crises everybody one meets in the street a lot of the u. n. officials who are still here say this is in if anything graver than the situation we were in at the beginning of the year because this time instead of rejecting the inspectors over something like the investigation of presidential sites these places that the iraqi's originally would not let the inspectors go this time we have got a rejection of the whole process and that is going to be a much much harder thing to fix
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.493.f1.raw  explain that a little bit more to us if you could what what is the the process that they are having a disagreement over as i understand it they have already been cleared pretty much by the u. n. on the issue whether they have nuclear or or a chemical weapons program and the issue is over biological capabilities
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.494.fx.raw  yes technically the nuclear and the missile file and the chemical file are not as yet wound up but the biological one is certainly the one that is causing the most problems but what the u. n. inspectors have been saying is oh just give us a little bit more detail and then you know round the corner will come the time when we can end the process and lift sanctions and the iraqis say well we have heard that again and again and now we are told you got to do this little bit more a little bit more more evidence more documents and at the same time the u. n. accusing them of not being honest with them about various things and they say well to hell with it we will not do this because it is not going to happen we are not going to get what we want so we are going to try and find another way
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.495.f1.raw  what kind of support do you think the iraqi's feel they can count on if the point they are basically trying to making is that the sanctions have been terribly punishing and that are no longer deserved especially from the point of view of the iraqi people
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.496.fx.raw  well i think they have got a lot of allies on the security council as well as in the region here who feel that the french the chinese and the russians on the security council are certainly suggested that they have sympathy with that view and i think in the region here even their old enemy iran seems to be taking a a rather more liberal view of things and perhaps that might be one area where they could actually suspend sanctions unilaterally if you like just restart trade with iran with syria perhaps also with jordan and just get on with it and say well we do not recognize sanctions

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.498.f0.raw  gerhard schroeder who is campaigning to be the next chancellor of germany in elections this september met today with president clinton in washington schroeder currently leads chancellor helmut kohl by three to four points in german opinion polls as the world's paul miller reports from washington there are some who are concerned about what a change in german government might mean
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.499.f0.raw  gerhard schroeder apparently has already learned a lot from bill clinton for example he has copied clinton's electoral campaign right down to the slogan it is the economy stupid schroeder would like to join mr clinton and britain's tony blair as new generation centrist leaders of western powers richard bert a former american ambassador to germany says schroeder should win simply because his opponent helmut kohl has been chancellor for sixteen years
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.500.f2.raw  most germans believe that it is time for a change and so most of the germans that i talked to and most of the experts that follow these things believe that it is very unlikely that kohl can hold onto power and that in one form or another gerhard schroeder will be the next chancellor
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.501.f0.raw  what changes schroeder would make as chancellor seem uncertain part of the reason for his trip to washington was to reassure officials here that while he heads a traditionally leftist party the social democratcs or s. p. d. he will continue germany's commitment to close relations with the united states and to european unity but ann phillips a professor at american university says schroeder would bring a different tone to relations with the united states she says the deference of kohl and other older germans based on gratitude for u. s. help in rebuilding their country after world war two would be gone and phillips says schroeder's s. p. d. does not accept the american idea that germany should take more responsibility in europe as long as it serves american interest too
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.502.f1.raw  more responsibility does not mean following u. s. policy what they are talking about is that europe should be an equal partner with the united states in global politics
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.503.f0.raw  as to specific policies gerhard schroeder is hard to pin down ann phillips says his pragmatism dominates
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.504.f1.raw  if you look at schroeder's policy one would be hard pressed to find core principals that have been the backbone of his political career unlike kohl who has always stood for european integration in the transatlantic relationship
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.505.f0.raw  schroeder's critics are less kind they say he changes policies as readily as he changes wives and he is on his fourth marriage chancellor kohl says schroeder stands for everything and nothing kohl is also raising the specter of an unworkable coalition government schroeder's party is not expected to win an outright majority in parliament and would have to find allies perhaps in what is called a red green coalition red for the s. p. d. and perhaps the former communists in eastern germany green for the environmentalist green party richard bert says differences between coalition members and within schroeder's s. p. d. party make it even harder to say what a schroeder government's policies might be
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.506.f2.raw  there will be some real battles between say the pragmatist wing of of the s. p. d. and the greens have their own pragmatist and the and the so called fundamentalists so there is a great deal of uncertainty i think if schroeder is elected about what german policy will look like in in the years ahead
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.507.f0.raw  right now schroeder is concentrating on winning the election by attacking kohl's economic record and by promising to lower unemployment and encourage entreprenuership and high technology specifics on policy may not matter that much to an electorate that apparently wants new faces and new ideas for now american officials will have to be content with general reassurances for the world i am paul miller in washington

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.510.f4.raw  you recognize this sound well in many parts of the world these days frogs are being heard less and less environmentalists are concerned and have been looking for an explanation and a cure for the dying frog populations even one of the latest
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.511.f0.raw  most promising theories on this disappearing frog problem now appears to be in trouble itself joining me now is dr john makero he is a professor of vertebrate ecology and zoology at griffith university gold coast in australia thanks for joining us professor scientists like yourself have been studying the problem of dying frog populations for close to twenty years if not more the so called fungus theory i guess was the latest attempt for a search for an answer what is it and why is it likely not to be the answer
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.512.fx.raw  the fungus has been found on the skin of some of dying frogs in just the last year or so it is not known whether this fungus is actually the cause of death for certain and but it is certainly is very exciting and promising the problem is that we cannot jump to the conclusion that as the cause of death and nor have can we then even make a much greater leap and say that it is actually the cause of the declines on a global scale
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.513.f1.raw  it is understandable that people would look for a single solution for a problem which is so big and so threatening so frightening in a way to environmentalists but is there likely to be a single answer
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.514.fx.raw  i i think it is very unlikely we have been had frogs missing in australia now since 1979 and many scientists around the world have been working on the problem if it was a simple answer then i think we would have hopefully found it a long time ago what we think is that frogs suffering from what we call immuno depression which means that they are not able to cope with normal diseases or infections like a fungus that they would have coped within the past and because of that then it has got to be something maybe even on a global scale something like global warming something like increased u. v. radiation all of these types of pressures which obviously have a human source weaken the frogs and therefore make them more susceptible to what otherwise might have been an acquired natural disease
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.515.f1.raw  like any species certainly the concern of people for its survival is a specific one but it is also more general is not it are frogs in a sense kind of a distant early warning system for us of threats that may be facing more more complicated animals humans themselves
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.516.fx.raw  well it is certainly the catch cries that we have been hearing is that the frogs may be the canary in the coal mine i think it is a good analogy i think if we find in australia for example we have seven species that have disappeared entirely and who is going to disappear next if it was something like the koala or the grizzly bear in north america then people would be screaming and yelling and they would be very much fearing for their own lives especially when it is mysterious these frogs are disappearing in relatively undisturbed areas they are in in australia in the core of large national parks
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.517.f1.raw  what about the biodiversity issue what what do we get from frogs that we would be losing if they were to die out
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.518.fx.raw  well one of the most interesting frogs in the world was the gastric brooding frog in australia where the female ate the eggs and the tadpoles developed inside her stomach
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.519.f1.raw 
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.520.fx.raw  somehow she produced chemicals in her stomach which stopped her from digesting her own tadpoles and her own babies now that chemical could have been extremely important for humans trying to solve the problem of stomach ulcers and so there was great potential for that particular species of frog to make a valuable contribution to medical science for humans it is hard to pinpoint the the value of something like a frog but it is certainly i think just inherent in its own right that it is a species on the planet as i am said earlier i guess like a grizzly bear or the bald eagle if we lose these species then we have lost a very part of our own heritage and our and our own life itself

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.626.f2.raw  there is always a concern that an action like this will will inspire further acts of violence and indeed in some cases spectacular acts of terrorism are are are followed by by smaller scale spontaneous acts because some people feel that now is the moment to to join the battle however insofar as further spectacular attacks those take months to plan and while they could occur in the near future that would be something that is already taking place now that is the planning would already be would already be in process

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.628.f2.raw  you know it is true that the the spectacular events do create an atmosphere of of fear and alarm and inevitably they will have an impact on the willingness of of tourists or business travelers to go to those to those countries however without sounding cold blooded or callous about the the the casualties involved i i think americans do have to keep in mind the magnitude of of of the threat the actual risks they take an average american citizen faces about a one in five thousand chance of dying in an automobile accident about a one in twelve thousand chance of being a victim of homicide in this country the probability of being killed by a terrorist abroad is one in millions so that suggests that people travelling abroad first of all drive very safely on the way to the airport
