/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_1.381.f2.raw  good morning on that social security situation i think first of all people do not realize a lot of people who go out and invest do not understand the markets very well one fifty per cent of all stocks in this country is owned by one per cent of the population before you start trying to turn it so the average individual will go out there and invest their social security money but they ought to first of all just get by the year two thousand and the y. two k. problem which many people feel was going to definitely bring the world into a terrible recession so let us say if we get by that then you people when you see the markets drop tremendously especially since a lot of stocks are selling right now at twenty times the earnings of the company which is pretty high some stocks are selling at fifty times yearly earnings of the company and if to me there is one factor that i have never heard anyone bring up that i think is interesting way that you should take the social security money and invest it and get a better return a lot of in a lot of firms in across the country they have real estate trusts that have done rather well the majority of the profits are made go back to the stock holders take the federal buildings across the country and maybe some rented federal lands and sell that at fair market value to the social security administration the social security administration will then form a real estate trust the american government people owning and through social security a lot of the government buildings and things across the country not the white house and not the congress of course they would then charge rent fair market value rent to the government and other companies for this property property their monies will come back into the government and be used to pay social security and they will probably get a much higher return than basically buying federal bonds

/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.626.f2.raw  there is always a concern that an action like this will will inspire further acts of violence and indeed in some cases spectacular acts of terrorism are are are followed by by smaller scale spontaneous acts because some people feel that now is the moment to to join the battle however insofar as further spectacular attacks those take months to plan and while they could occur in the near future that would be something that is already taking place now that is the planning would already be would already be in process
/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.628.f2.raw  you know it is true that the the spectacular events do create an atmosphere of of fear and alarm and inevitably they will have an impact on the willingness of of tourists or business travelers to go to those to those countries however without sounding cold blooded or callous about the the the casualties involved i i think americans do have to keep in mind the magnitude of of of the threat the actual risks they take an average american citizen faces about a one in five thousand chance of dying in an automobile accident about a one in twelve thousand chance of being a victim of homicide in this country the probability of being killed by a terrorist abroad is one in millions so that suggests that people travelling abroad first of all drive very safely on the way to the airport
