/lab/speech/sphinx4/data/hub4/eval99/supervised/bn99en_2.501.f0.raw  what changes schroeder would make as chancellor seem uncertain part of the reason for his trip to washington was to reassure officials here that while he heads a traditionally leftist party the social democratcs or s. p. d. he will continue germany's commitment to close relations with the united states and to european unity but ann phillips a professor at american university says schroeder would bring a different tone to relations with the united states she says the deference of kohl and other older germans based on gratitude for u. s. help in rebuilding their country after world war two would be gone and phillips says schroeder's s. p. d. does not accept the american idea that germany should take more responsibility in europe as long as it serves american interest too
