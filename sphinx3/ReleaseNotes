	Sphinx 3.7.0 Final
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	(Corresponds to Sourceforge SVN rev 7173.)

	This version requires sphinxbase 0.3.

	This version has been tested on the following platforms:
		* i686-linux (RedHat 9, Fedora Core 5, Ubuntu Feisty)
		* x86_64-linux (Fedora Core 3, Fedora Core 5, Ubuntu Feisty)
		* sparc-solaris (Solaris 9)
		* powerpc-darwin (Mac OS X 10.3)

	The testing framework has been improved to use the built-in
	facilities provided by automake.  Failed tests will be
	reported at the end of a 'make check' run.

	The allphone decoder has been cleaned up and better
	integrated with the rest of the system.  The ad-hoc phoneme
	lattice and phone transition probability file formats are no
	longer supported.  Also, a dictionary file is now required,
	though it need not contain anything.

	The sphinx3_allphone and sphinx3_decode_anytopo programs have
	been removed as they are no longer needed.  For the former,
	use 'sphinx3_decode -mode allphone', for the latter, use
	'sphinx3_decode_anytopo -mode fwdflat'.

	A simple Python interface for live and batch
	decoding is included in the python/ directory.  It is not
	compiled by default.  To install it, install sphinx3, then run
	'python setup.py install'.

	pkg-config files are now installed to make it easier to use
	Sphinx3 from other applications.

	Word lattices can now be output in HTK format (-outlatfmt htk).

	The live-decoding interface has changed again, for some
	reason.  Use s3_decode.h instead of live_decode_API.h.  You
	will need to do front-end processing yourself, see fe.h from
	SphinxBase for the relevant functions.

	N-best list output is integrated into the decoder.  N-best
	lists can be obtained through the s3_decode.h API by getting the
	DAG object and using the API from astar.h on it.

	Bestpath and N-best decode now work in all operation modes
	except FSG.

	The operation modes use text strings instead of numbers.

	The flat decoder (-mode fwdflat) now gives equivalent error
	rates to Sphinx 3.0.

	Many other bugs and memory leaks have been fixed.

	Sphinx 3.7.0 Release Candidate I
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	(Corresponds to Sourceforge SVN rev 5995.)

	Sphinx 3.7 starts to assume the applications/library
	architecture.  Most of the utility function will be physically
	migrated to sphinxbase 0.2.  sphinxbase 0.2 will then be shared
	by both pocketsphinx and sphinx3.  

	In the case of Sphinx 3.7, the way it searches for sphinxbase 
	will simply by 
	1, see whether it appears system-wide. 
	2, see whether it appears in the parent directory (../sphinxbase)

	This is an important change, that means we start to
	consciously avoid code duplication in the module level.  In future,
	this effort will be continued on SphinxTrain or may be
	sphinx2.

	Sphinx 3.7.0 RCI is only a release candidate, for a stable single
	executably release, they are advised to use sphinx 3.6.3.  We
	expect that there will be a fairly long release candidate
	period before 3.7 could be officially released. 

	From Sphinx 3.6.3:
	-(rev 5979, 5983, 5985, 5990, 5992, 5993) Sphinx 3.7.0 Release
	Candidate I offloaded most of the utility function to
	sphinxbase 0.2.
	-(rev 5981) Added LDA into sphinx3.  Currently it supports only
	1-stream features. 

	For developers:
	-Many wholistic tests are now relocated in sphinxbase. Now
	make distcheck will generate 79 PASSes.  
	-make distcheck need to be run with
	DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS=--with-sphinxbase=`pwd`/../sphinxbase

	Sphinx 3.6.3
	^^^^^^^^^^^^
	(Corresponds to Sourceforge SVN rev 5957.)
	Sphinx 3.6.3 is a bug fix release. 

	(rev 5906) The hypseg generated by sphinx3_decode (mode 4) was ill
	-formed.  This used to corrupt sphinx3_conf in confidence generation. 
	This is now fixed. 
	
	(rev 5912) Frame length is now checked to make sure it is smaller
	than #fft points.  The #ffts is also checked to see if it is a
	power of 2. 

	For Developers
	(rev 5915) sphinx3_conf is now tested. PASS counts is now 98
	in make check
	(rev 5955) wave2feat is not installed in sphinx3.  Users and 
	developers are recommended to use the SphinxTrain version
	instead. 
      

2006-07-07  Arthur Chan (archan@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
	Sphinx 3.6.2
	^^^^^^^^^^^^
	(Corresponds to Sourceforge SVN rev 5842.)
	Sphinx 3.6.2 fixed another issue related to 32bit LM: it now allows
	the use of LM with tg_seg size more than 0xffff.  It also includea
	a complete but un-tested version of full-covariance acoustic models. 

	Several bug fixes:

	(rev 5814) When decode, decode_anytopo or lm_convert were used
	to read in LM with unigram less than 0xffff words, previous
	code assumed the LM is in 16 bit mode.  Now lm_convert
	will back-off to use 32 bit mode to read in.  Users, except
	those who happened to read this message, will have no idea this
	happens. 
	(rev 5794) Fixed a compile warning which also happened to be
	a bug.  A 16 bit LM Word id was used in the 32 bit LM-mode.  This 
	caused problem when users put <s> and </s> outside the range of 0xffff. 
	
	Developing Features:
	(rev 5757:5761,5763,5771,5774:5776) Incorporated full covariance
	matrix as in acoustic modeling. 
	(rev 5766) Fixed front-end issues, now sphinx 3.6 can accept
	feature that was accepted in Sphinx 3.0 (or archive_s3)

	For Developers:
	(rev 5785, 5786, 5791 and 5792) sphinx3 is now indented using 
	the scheme originally designed for PocketSphinx and sphinxbase. 
	(rev 5819) Several tests are added to support the fixes. 
	Now PASSes count in make check is 97.

	Sphinx 3.6.1
	^^^^^^^^^^^^
	(Corresponds to Sourceforge SVN rev 5753.)

	Sphinx 3.6.1 (from rev 5660) enables 32-bit LM.  It is tested
	under a real-life scenario and shows to provide better
	results. Also LTS code has bug so it was not truly enabled in 
	official sphinx 3.6

	Several bug fixes:
	-(rev 5621) Random crash with multiple LMs. 
	-(rev 5639) Don't allow ld_end_utt() to be called if ld_begin_utt() hasn't been
 	called (this leads to crashing and badness).
	-(rev 5663) Fixed FST output behavior. 
	-(rev 5711) Fixed underflow problem of ug if backoff weight is
	too small (<< 0). LTS now truely enabled.
	-(rev 5730) Fixed Visual Studio 8.0 compilation
	-(rev 5732) Fixed astar memory problem, tested in a 64000 words scenario. 
	
	Developing features:
	-(rev 5738) full covariance matrices
	-(rev 5744) Enable fast GMM computation for align.

	Sphinx 3.6 Official Release
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	(Corresponds to Sourceforge SVN rev 5614.)
	
	Sphinx 3.6 official release included all changes we found in
	Sphinx 3.6 RC I.

	From 3.6 RC I to 3.6 official: 

 	New Features: 
	-Added support for sphinx-2-style semi-continuous HMM in Sphinx 3. 
	-Added sphinx3_continuous which performs on-line decoding in
	both windows and linux platforms.
	-Synchronized the frontend with Sphinx2, adding implementation of VTLN.
	(i.e.  -warp_type = inverse_linear, piewise_linear, affine) 

 	Changes: 
	-Prefix "sphinx3_" has been added to programs align, allphone,
	astar, dag, decode, decode_anytopo, ep to avoid confusion in
	some unix systems.

 	For Developers: 
	-All public headers (*.h) are now put under $root/include instead
	of the same directories as their source .c file.
	-The directory name libutil is now changed to libs3util 
	-Sphinx3, as well as all other modules in the CMU Sphinx
	project, is now versioned by Subversion.
	
	Bug Fixes: 
	-[1459402] Serious memory relocation is fixed.  
	-In RCI, -dither was not properly implemented, this has been fixed.  

 	Known Problem:

	Sphinx 3.6 Release Candidate I
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	The corresponding SphinxTrain's tag is SPHINX3_6_CMU_INTERNAL_RELEASE
	One can check out the matching SphinxTrain of the sphinx3.6 release by command,
	svn co https://cmusphinx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cmusphinx/tags/SPHINX3_6_CMU_INTERNAL_RELEASE/SphinxTrain

	A Summary of Sphinx 3.6 RC I
	----------------------------

	Sphinx 3.6 is a gently refactored version of Sphinx 3.5.  Our
	programming is defensive and we only aim at further
	consolidation and unification our code-bases in Sphinx 3.

	Despite our programming is defensive, there are still several
	interesting and new features could be found in this
	release. Their details could be found in the "New Feature"
	section below. Here is a brief summary:
	
	1, Further speed-up of CIGMMS in the 4 level GMM Computation
	Schemes (4LGC)
	2, Multiple regression classes an MAP adaptation in SphinxTrain
	3, Better support in using LM in Sphinx 3.X.  
	4, FSG search is now supported. This is adapted from Sphinx 2. 
	5, Support of full triphone search in flat lexicon search. 
	6, Some support of different character sets other than of
	Sphinx 3.X.  Models in multiple languages are now tested in
	Sphinx 3.X.

	We hope you enjoy this release candidate. In future, we will
	continue to improve the quality of CMU Sphinx and CMU Sphinx's
	related software.

	New Features 
	------------
	-Speaker Adaptation:
	a, Multiple regression class (phoneme-based) is now supported. 
	
	-GMM Computation 
	a, Improvements of CIGMMs is now incorporated. 
	  i, One could specify the upper limit of the number of CD
	  senones to be computed in each frame by specifying -maxcdsenpf.
          ii, The best Gaussian index (BGI) are not stored and could
	  be used as a mechanism to speed up GMM computation
	  iii, tightening-factor (-tighten_factor) is introduced to
	  smooth between fix naive down-sampling technique and CI-GMMS.
	b, Support of SCHMM and FCHMM
	  i, decode will fully support computation of SCHMM. 
	
	-Language Model 
	a, reading an LM in ARPA text format is now supported. Users
	now have an option to by-pass the use of lm3g2dmp.
	b, live decoding API now supports switching of language models. 
	c, full support of class-based LM. See also the Bug fixes section
	d, lm_convert is introduced. lm_convert supersede the
	functionalities of lm3g2dmp. Not only could lm_convert convert an LM 
	from TXT format to DMP format.  It could also do the reverse.  

	-Search 
	This part will detail the change we make in different search
	algorithms.
	In 3.6, collection of algorithms could all be used under a
	single executable decode.  decode_anytopo is still reserved
	for backward compatibility purpose. 
	Decode now support three modes of search. 
	Mode 2 (FSG): (Adapted from Sphinx 2) FSG search. 
	Mode 3 (FLAT): Flat-lexicon search. (The original search in decode_anytopo in 3.X (X < 6))
	Mode 4 (TREE): Tree-lexicion search. (The original search in decode in 3.X (x<6) 
		
	Some of these functionalities will only be applicable in one
	particular search. We will mark them with FSG, FLAT and TREE. 

	a, One could now turn off -bt_wsil to control whether silence
	should be used as the ending word.  (FLAT, TREE)
	b, In FLAT, full triphones could be used instead of
	multiplexed triphones. 
	c, FSG is a new added routine in 3.6 which is adapted from
	Sphinx 2.5

	-Frontend
	a, -dither is now supported in live_pretend and
	live_decode, the initial seed could always be set the command
	-seed. (Jerry Wolf will be very happy about this feature.)

	-Miscellaneous
	a, One could turn on built-in letter-to-sound rule in dict.c by using -lts_mismatch. 
	b, current Sphinx 3.6 is tested to work on setup of English,
	Chinese Mandarin, French and English. 
	c, changes in allphone: allphone can now generate a match and a matchseg just like
	decode* recognizers. 

	Bug fixes
	---------
	-Miscellaneous memory leak fixed in the tree search (mode 4)
	-Initialization class-based LM routine use to switch the order of
	word insertion penalty and language model weight. This is now fixed. 
	-Assertion generated vithist.c is now turn into an error
	message.  Instead of causing the whole program stopped.  The
	decoding will just fail for that sentnece.  We suspect that this is
	the problem which caused possible wipe out of memory in Sphinx
	3.4 & 3.5		
	-Number of CI phones could now be at most 32767 (instead of 127)
	-[1236322]: libutil\str2words special character bugs. 

	Behavior Changes
	----------------
	-Endpointer (ep) now used computation of s3 log. 

	-Multi-stream GMM computation will not truncate the pdf to 8
	bit anymore.  This will avoid confusion of programmer. However

	-Except in allphone and align, When .cont. is used in
	-senmgau, the code will automatically turn to use fast GMM computation
	routine. To make sure the multiple-stream GMM computation will
	be in effect, one need to specify .s3cont.

	-executable dag hadn't accounted for the language weight.  Now
	this issue is fixed.
	
	-(See Bug fixes also) decode will now return error message
	when vithist was fed in with history -1.  Instead of asserting
	the problem.  The recognizer will dump Warning
	message. Usually that means beam widths need to increase. 

	Functions still under test 
	-----------------------------------------
	-Encoding conversion in lm_convert. 
	-LIUM contribution: LM could now represented as AT&T fsm format. 

	Known bugs
	------------------------------------------
	-Confidence estimation, the computations of forward and
	backward posterior probability have mismatch
	-In allphone, sometimes the scores generated in the matchseg file 
	will have very low scores. 
	-Regression test on second-stage search still have bugs.
